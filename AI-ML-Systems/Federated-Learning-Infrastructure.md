# Federated Learning Infrastructure

## Objective
Design and implement infrastructure to support federated learning (FL), allowing multiple clients (e.g., edge devices, enterprise partners, or data silos) to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data—preserving privacy and complying with data regulations.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Enable privacy-preserving ML collaboration across organizational boundaries
- Ensure scalability and fault-tolerance for distributed training nodes
- Minimize communication and computation overhead for federated nodes
- Establish trust and transparency across all participating entities

---

## Use Cases
| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Mobility | Personalizing ETA or routing models using driver phones |
| Healthcare | Partner hospitals training joint diagnostics without sharing PII |
| Finance | AML or fraud detection across banks without centralizing transactions |
| Retail | Federated demand forecasting across regions or franchises |

## Core Components
- **Client Nodes**: Local agents that train on private data (e.g., mobile SDKs, on-prem servers)
- **Coordinator Server**: Orchestrates training rounds, aggregates model updates
- **Model Registry**: Version control and lineage tracking for global and local models
- **Secure Aggregation**: Differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, or secure multiparty computation
- **Communication Layer**: Optimized, fault-tolerant transport (e.g., gRPC, MQTT, HTTP2)

---

## Learning Strategies
- **FedAvg**: Clients compute gradients locally; coordinator averages and updates global model
- **FedProx**: Adjusts for client heterogeneity
- **Personalized FL**: Tailors parts of model (e.g., last layers) to individual users
- **Split Learning**: Client handles early layers; server completes forward/backward pass

---

## Operational Infrastructure
- Federated orchestration platform (e.g., NVIDIA FLARE, Flower, PySyft)
- Containerized or serverless execution on edge devices
- Scheduled training and retry mechanisms for intermittent clients
- Client registration, heartbeat monitoring, and dropout resilience

---

## Privacy and Governance
- Differential privacy and local noise injection
- Compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA for data handling boundaries
- Audit logs of training participation and model lifecycle
- Role-based visibility into aggregated outcomes only

---

## Metrics of Success
- Convergence quality vs centralized model baselines
- Client participation rate and dropout recovery
- Communication cost per round (MB/client)
- Privacy budget consumed (ϵ in differential privacy)
- Model performance consistency across segments

---

## Summary
Federated learning infrastructure extends the reach of AI to sensitive and distributed environments, unlocking collaborative intelligence while respecting data sovereignty. With robust orchestration, encryption, and privacy guarantees, FL becomes a strategic enabler for responsible innovation at scale.
