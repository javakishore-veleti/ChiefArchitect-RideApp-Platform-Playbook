# A/B Testing for Models

## Objective
Establish a robust experimentation framework to compare machine learning models, configurations, or policy variations in production—validating model impact through controlled A/B testing.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Drive evidence-based model rollout decisions
- Reduce deployment risk by testing performance incrementally
- Measure uplift in key business and technical metrics
- Improve model iteration through real-world feedback loops

---

## Typical A/B Use Cases
| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Personalization | New recommendation model vs existing baseline |
| Fraud Detection | Updated thresholds or classifier logic |
| Pricing | Alternate pricing policies (RL or regression-based) |
| Support Automation | NLP model for ticket routing or classification |

---

## Experiment Design
- **Control Group**: Receives current or baseline model
- **Treatment Group(s)**: Receives candidate model(s)
- **Randomization**: User/session-level consistent hashing
- **Holdout Size**: 5–50% based on sensitivity and traffic volume
- **Duration**: Typically 1–4 weeks or until statistical significance

---

## Metrics to Track
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Model | Precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, drift |
| Business | CTR, conversions, revenue, cancellations |
| Latency | P95 response time, cold start delay |
| Operational | Crash rate, fallback usage, model cost |

---

## Technical Infrastructure
- Feature store with time-consistent snapshots
- Shadow traffic routing for dry runs (before real exposure)
- Unified metrics pipelines for logging across variants
- Dashboarding for live tracking and alerting
- A/B test orchestration system (e.g., Optimizely, custom)

---

## Governance and Ethics
- Fairness audits across segments (age, gender, region)
- Guardrails to cap exposure of high-risk models
- Opt-out and rollback logic at session or cohort level
- Model cards for candidates with risk annotations

---

## Advanced Techniques
- Multivariate testing with factorial design
- Bayesian inference for faster decision making
- Interleaving for recommender comparisons
- CUPED (Controlled Pre-Experiment Data) variance reduction

---

## Metrics of Success
- Time-to-decision for model rollout
- Lift over baseline with confidence bounds
- False positive/negative impact on downstream systems
- % of successful model launches backed by A/B tests
- Reduction in manual rollback incidents

---

## Summary
A/B testing for models ensures data-driven deployment with clear uplift validation. It creates a safety net for production innovation, supporting rapid iteration and trustworthy model lifecycle management at scale.
