# Personalization Engine

## Objective
Develop a scalable, real-time personalization engine to tailor experiences, recommendations, and interactions across the platformâ€”enhancing user satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Deliver hyper-relevant experiences for riders, drivers, and partners
- Increase user retention and loyalty through dynamic personalization
- Support A/B testing and model tuning for experience optimization
- Maintain explainability and fairness in personalization decisions

---

## Personalization Use Cases
| Domain | Personalization Examples |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Rider App | Pickup location suggestions, loyalty perks, preferred routes |
| Driver App | Zone incentives, heatmap guidance, offer prioritization |
| Promotions | Dynamic discounting, referral tailoring, upsell campaigns |
| Support | Recommended help articles, chat routing, response tone matching |

## Architecture Overview
- **User Profiles**: Real-time store of preferences, behaviors, and segments
- **Event Pipeline**: Kafka-based stream for clickstreams, trip logs, feedback
- **Recommendation Engine**: Collaborative filtering + content-based hybrid models
- **Feature Store**: Cached vectors (e.g., recency, frequency, rec. scores)
- **Serving API**: REST/gRPC service with low-latency personalization queries

---

## Modeling Techniques
- Matrix Factorization, LightFM, DeepRec
- User embeddings from interaction histories (Word2Vec-style)
- Contextual bandits for explore-exploit tradeoffs
- Real-time scoring with fallback logic and multi-armed bandits
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks) for long-term engagement optimization

---

## Governance & Controls
- Bias detection and fairness auditing across segments
- Frequency capping and personalization fatigue safeguards
- Consent and opt-out controls for recommendation tracking
- Versioned recommendation policies with rollout toggles

---

## Feedback Loop
- Implicit signals: clicks, accepts, skips, dwell time
- Explicit ratings and reactions
- Continuous retraining of ranking models
- Experimentation-driven improvements (via A/B tests)
- Reinforcement signals based on reward feedback from user actions

---

## Metrics of Success
- Click-through rate (CTR) lift vs baseline
- Conversion rate uplift (e.g., offer acceptance, repeat rides)
- Engagement retention by cohort
- Fairness score across personalization dimensions
- System latency for rec delivery (P95 < 150ms)
- Cumulative reward gain from reinforcement policies

---

## Summary
The personalization engine transforms user interactions into intelligent, real-time experiences. By leveraging behavioral data, feedback loops, reinforcement learning, and ethical AI practices, it creates a sticky, delightful platform that adapts to users while respecting privacy and trust.
