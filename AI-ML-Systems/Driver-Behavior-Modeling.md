# Driver Behavior Modeling

## Objective
Design machine learning systems that continuously analyze and learn from driver behavior to improve safety, service quality, fraud detection, and operational efficiency.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Enhance safety through early detection of risky behaviors
- Improve ride quality and customer satisfaction scores
- Support fair incentives and performance-based recognition
- Reduce operational cost by flagging anomalies, inefficiencies, or misuse

---

## Key Behavioral Signals
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Driving Patterns | Speeding, harsh braking, cornering, acceleration bursts |
| Trip Handling | Late pickups, route deviations, long idle times |
| Rider Interaction | Cancelation rates, response time, feedback comments |
| Device/Usage | Phone orientation, multitasking during trip, app switching |

---

## Data Sources
- Mobile app sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS)
- Trip metadata (timestamps, route, ETA adherence)
- Rider and platform feedback (ratings, flags, chat logs)
- Historical behavior benchmarks per region or fleet type

---

## Modeling Techniques
- Anomaly detection (autoencoders, isolation forests)
- Sequence models (LSTM, GRU) for temporal patterns
- Graph-based profiling (e.g., drivers in proximity clusters)
- Supervised classification (safe vs unsafe, engaged vs disengaged)

---

## Scoring Framework
- Composite driver behavior score updated daily
- Weighted scoring across safety, punctuality, feedback
- Threshold-based alerts or intervention workflows
- Personalized feedback and gamified dashboards

---

## Platform Integration
- Behavior dashboard visible to drivers and ops teams
- Risk signals integrated into allocation and matching logic
- Automated incentives or warnings based on trends
- Feedback loop from enforcement outcomes (manual reviews, appeals)

---

## Governance and Fairness
- Regional normalization to reduce socio-demographic bias
- Opt-out mechanisms and transparency for scoring criteria
- Privacy-preserving analysis for edge inference
- Regular audits of false positives/negatives and feedback loop tuning

---

## Metrics of Success
- Reduction in high-risk incidents per 10K trips
- Increase in average driver safety scores
- Decrease in rider complaints tied to behavior
- Participation in feedback review or gamification features
- Improvement in match rate for high-score drivers

---

## Summary
Driver behavior modeling transforms raw telemetry and feedback data into actionable intelligence. By promoting safety, rewarding quality, and flagging anomalies, the platform ensures a trusted experience for riders and a fair, data-informed ecosystem for drivers.
