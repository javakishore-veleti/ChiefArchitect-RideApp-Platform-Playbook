# Model Evaluation and Audit Pipelines

## Objective
Establish systematic pipelines for model evaluation and auditing to ensure fairness, accuracy, explainability, and regulatory compliance before and after deployment.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Validate model fitness using quantitative and qualitative criteria
- Identify hidden biases and ensure fairness across cohorts
- Provide audit trails for explainability and compliance
- Enable reproducible and automated evaluation at scale

---

## Evaluation Dimensions
| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Performance** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC, RMSE, MAPE |
| **Fairness** | Demographic parity, Equal opportunity, Group-wise AUC |
| **Robustness** | Adversarial sensitivity, data corruption tolerance |
| **Explainability** | SHAP, LIME, feature importance variance |
| **Operational** | Latency, resource usage, cold start behavior |

---

## Audit Pipeline Components
- **Pre-Deployment Checks**:
  - Baseline comparison
  - Dataset bias scan
  - Cross-validation stability
  - Label leakage checks

- **Post-Deployment Checks**:
  - Shadow model comparisons
  - Drift from training to inference distribution
  - Business outcome deltas by cohort

- **Artifact Registry**:
  - Evaluation reports, metrics, plots
  - Model cards with assumptions and limitations
  - Signed audit logs and approval status

---

## Tooling and Infrastructure
- **Frameworks**: scikit-learn, XAI libraries (SHAP, Alibi, LIME)
- **Pipelines**: Kubeflow, MLflow, Metaflow, Airflow
- **Storage**: Central model registry + metadata store
- **Governance Dashboards**: Role-based access, compliance snapshots

---

## Compliance and Governance
- Align to internal and regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, EEOC, HIPAA)
- Track evaluation lineage for re-trained models
- Periodic audit reviews and sign-off workflows
- Alerting on fairness or performance degradation

---

## Metrics of Success
- Time-to-audit for newly trained models
- % of models passing fairness and robustness checks
- Number of automated checks vs manual overrides
- Rate of post-deployment regressions detected via audits
- Audit coverage across all active production models

---

## Summary
Model evaluation and audit pipelines are the last line of defense before a model influences decisions at scale. They ensure models meet business, technical, and ethical standardsâ€”enabling trust, accountability, and sustained performance over time.
