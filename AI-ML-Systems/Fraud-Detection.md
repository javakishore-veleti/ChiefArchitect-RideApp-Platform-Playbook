# Fraud Detection

## Objective
Design and implement intelligent fraud detection systems to proactively identify, score, and respond to anomalous behaviors in real-timeâ€”safeguarding platform integrity, financial accuracy, and user trust.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Prevent fraudulent transactions, fake accounts, and abuse patterns
- Minimize false positives to protect user experience
- Leverage ML to detect sophisticated, evolving fraud types
- Maintain real-time and batch processing for scoring and investigation

---

## Key Fraud Scenarios
| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fake Users | Synthetic or duplicated user profiles for promotions or scams |
| GPS Spoofing | Fake location signals to game incentives or manipulate availability |
| Payment Fraud | Stolen card use, chargebacks, duplicate payments |
| Referral Abuse | Self-referrals or referral rings exploiting reward programs |
| Identity Misuse | Stolen or mismatched documents in onboarding |

## Detection Approaches

### ðŸ”¹ Rule-Based Layer
- First line of defense: velocity checks, threshold logic, geo-fencing
- Implemented via policy engine (e.g., OPA, Drools)

### ðŸ”¹ ML Layer
- Anomaly detection using clustering, autoencoders, or Isolation Forests
- Supervised learning on labeled fraud/non-fraud data
- Graph analytics for ring/network detection

### ðŸ”¹ Hybrid
- Combine rules + ML scoring + human-in-loop for adjudication
- Escalation logic for grey-zone predictions

---

## Model Features
- Temporal: time of day, account age, ride frequency
- Spatial: pickup/dropoff distance anomalies, zone mismatch
- Behavioral: average ratings, device ID churn, interaction speed
- Network: shared IPs, referral trees, account graph linkages

---

## Architecture
- Event-driven pipeline with Kafka triggers and feature joiner
- Real-time scoring via low-latency inference layer (REST/gRPC)
- Decision logs sent to investigation dashboard
- Streaming feedback loop to retrain on confirmed frauds

---

## Ops & Governance
- Case management tool for Ops investigations
- SLA for fraud score latency and response time
- Drift and precision-recall monitoring dashboards
- Manual override capability and explainability UI

---

## Metrics of Success
- False positive and false negative rates
- Detection lead time (event-to-detection delta)
- $ fraud prevented per 10K bookings
- Fraud report resolution time
- Auto-resolution rate vs human intervention

---

## Summary
A robust fraud detection system is essential for protecting the ride platformâ€™s financial, reputational, and operational health. By blending real-time scoring, ML models, and investigative workflows, the system ensures a balance of security, scale, and user fairness.
