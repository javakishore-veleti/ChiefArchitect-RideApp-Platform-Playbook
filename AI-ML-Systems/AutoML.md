# AutoML for Citizen Data Scientists

## Objective
Democratize machine learning by empowering non-expert users—analysts, operations managers, and domain specialists—to build and deploy ML models using AutoML tools, with guided workflows and guardrails for safety, quality, and scalability.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Expand access to machine learning beyond central data science teams
- Reduce dependency on manual tuning and ML pipeline engineering
- Promote rapid experimentation and insights from subject matter experts
- Maintain governance over model quality and compliance

---

## Target Users
- Ops managers exploring churn or supply forecasts
- Marketing teams running lead scoring or promo uplift models
- Product teams testing feature adoption predictors
- Business analysts performing segmentation or anomaly detection

---

## AutoML Capabilities
| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Upload CSV, connect to DBs or data warehouse, profile features |
| **Target Selection** | Choose classification, regression, or time series objective |
| **Feature Engineering** | Auto-generation of aggregates, encodings, time features |
| **Model Selection** | Automated comparison of XGBoost, LightGBM, RF, ElasticNet, etc. |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Grid/random search or Bayesian optimization |
| **Explainability** | Feature importance, prediction explanations, bias indicators |
| **Deployment** | One-click API deployment, or export to BI tools |

## Tools & Platform Examples
- Google Vertex AI AutoML
- AWS SageMaker Autopilot
- H2O Driverless AI
- DataRobot
- Open-source: AutoGluon, FLAML, PyCaret

---

## Governance and Safeguards
- Pre-checks for data imbalance, leakage, or schema issues
- Constraints on target variable type and model complexity
- Approval workflows for model publishing to production
- Access control and usage tracking per persona/team
- Ethical guardrails: fairness tests, explainability checks, opt-out support

---

## Success Metrics
- # of models published by non-DS users
- Time-to-insight reduction (vs traditional modeling cycles)
- Uplift in decision accuracy vs heuristic baselines
- User satisfaction and adoption rate of AutoML tools
- Governance violation rate or rollback incidents

---

## Summary
AutoML for Citizen Data Scientists democratizes access to AI capabilities, enabling faster, domain-informed experimentation without deep ML expertise. With curated tooling and governance, it extends the intelligence edge across business teams—safely and at scale.
