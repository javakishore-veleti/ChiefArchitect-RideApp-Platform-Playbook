# Model Monitoring & Drift Detection

## Objective
Implement robust systems to monitor machine learning models in productionâ€”tracking their performance, reliability, and data integrity while detecting and responding to concept and data drift.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Ensure model accuracy and relevance post-deployment
- Detect data or concept drift before performance degradation
- Enable automated alerts and retraining triggers
- Maintain regulatory compliance through audit trails

---

## What to Monitor
| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Performance** | Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, RMSE |
| **Data Integrity** | Missing values, distribution shifts, type mismatches |
| **Drift Metrics** | PSI, KL divergence, KS test, embedding drift |
| **Operational** | Latency (P50, P95), uptime, error rate, throughput |
| **Business Impact** | Conversion, revenue per inference, rejection rate |

## Types of Drift
- **Data Drift**: Input distribution changes (e.g., seasonal, demographic)
- **Concept Drift**: Target relationship change (e.g., user behavior shifts)
- **Model Drift**: Decay in prediction quality without obvious input shift

---

## Monitoring Architecture
- **Logging Pipelines**: Input/output data, predictions, timestamps
- **Feature Store Hooks**: Pre/post transformation checks
- **Metrics Store**: Aggregation of KPIs over sliding windows
- **Drift Detection Engine**: Scheduled statistical tests per feature/model
- **Alerting Layer**: Prometheus + Alertmanager, Datadog, Slack, PagerDuty

---

## Tools & Techniques
- EvidentlyAI, WhyLogs, Arize, Fiddler, AWS Model Monitor, custom dashboards
- Statistical tests: PSI (Population Stability Index), JS/KL divergence
- Embedding monitoring for NLP/CV models
- Canary models and shadow deployment comparisons

---

## Response Strategies
- Threshold-based alert escalation (soft vs hard)
- Automated retraining and model promotion workflows
- Manual investigation with Jupyter dashboards
- Root cause diagnosis via feature importance drift

---

## Governance and Auditability
- Lineage tracking: data source, transformation, prediction event
- Model version monitoring with changelogs
- Audit logs for overrides, alert responses, retrain triggers
- Role-based access to sensitive metrics and drift dashboards

---

## Metrics of Success
- Drift detection lead time before business impact
- % of drifts with automated mitigation in place
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR) model performance degradation
- Alert precision/recall (true anomalies vs noise)
- Increase in model uptime and SLA adherence

---

## Summary
Model monitoring and drift detection ensure reliable AI in production. By tracking model behavior, detecting shifts, and enabling fast response loops, platforms can maintain model trustworthiness, improve decision quality, and comply with operational and ethical standards.
