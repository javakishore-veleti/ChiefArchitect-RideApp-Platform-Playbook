# Contextual NLP Services

## Objective
Design intelligent NLP services that adapt to context—user, domain, intent, and platform state—enabling accurate, personalized, and safe natural language understanding and generation for core platform workflows.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Move beyond generic NLP to context-aware understanding
- Personalize language models based on user profile, history, or task intent
- Improve robustness in dynamic or multi-turn conversational settings
- Ensure safety, traceability, and responsiveness of language-driven features

---

## Key Use Cases
| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Support Automation | Classify issue type and escalate or resolve using context (past rides, status) |
| Driver Messaging | Intent-aware assistant for navigation, incident reporting, or earnings queries |
| Rider Conversations | Sentiment detection and situation-specific handling during disruptions |
| Voice Interfaces | Context-aware ASR and NLU for in-app commands |
| Knowledge Retrieval | Contextual semantic search from ops/playbooks or documentation |

## Architecture Components
- **NLP Gateway**: Routes queries to appropriate model/service (intent, summarization, QA)
- **Context Enrichment Layer**: Adds user metadata, temporal signals, task state, or past utterances
- **Embedding Store**: Maintains vector representations for dynamic lookups
- **Contextual LM APIs**: Fine-tuned LLMs or transformer models with user/session awareness
- **Postprocessing & Governance**: Filters, redaction, and scoring for toxicity, hallucination, or bias

---

## Modeling Approaches
- **Multi-task Transformers**: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT with fine-tuning heads
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine retrieval with generation for high accuracy
- **Slot Filling + Intent Classification**: Multi-label tagging for conversational understanding
- **Custom Tokenization**: Handle multi-lingual, code-mixed, or domain-specific lexicons

---

## Deployment Considerations
- Real-time SLAs for voice/typing latency (sub-300ms target)
- Session caching and contextual persistence across messages
- Versioning and rollback of fine-tuned models
- Feature flags for controlled rollout by cohort/locale

---

## Governance & Safety
- Input/output logging for traceability and root cause triage
- Prompt injection and adversarial input defense
- Detection of hallucinations, PII leakage, or toxicity
- Human-in-the-loop fallback for low-confidence answers

---

## Metrics of Success
- Intent classification accuracy, NLU F1 score
- User satisfaction (CSAT) in NLP-assisted tasks
- Average response latency under load
- % of NLP queries requiring human fallback
- Hallucination or safety incident rate over time

---

## Summary
Contextual NLP services bring sophistication to language understanding by grounding interpretation in who the user is, what they’re doing, and where they are in the product journey. With layered context enrichment, adaptive models, and robust governance, they elevate support, safety, and personalization across the platform.
