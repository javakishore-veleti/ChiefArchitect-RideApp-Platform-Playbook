# GPU/TPU Infra Management

## Objective
Establish scalable, cost-efficient infrastructure for provisioning, scheduling, and monitoring high-performance compute resources like GPUs and TPUs to support AI/ML workloads across experimentation and production.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Optimize utilization and cost of GPU/TPU resources
- Enable fair, prioritized scheduling for experimentation and inference
- Ensure reliability, traceability, and SLA compliance of compute jobs
- Align resource usage with organizational policies and budgets

---

## Key Responsibilities
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Provisioning** | Elastic allocation of GPU/TPU clusters via Kubernetes or cloud APIs |
| **Scheduling** | Job queueing with priority, fairness, and resource guarantees |
| **Monitoring** | Track usage by project/user, detect stragglers or idle time |
| **Autoscaling** | Dynamic scaling of worker nodes based on demand curves |
| **Billing & Quotas** | Per-team limits, chargeback reports, cost visibility dashboards |

---

## Platform Architecture
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (GKE, EKS) with NVIDIA/TPU node pools
- **Job Schedulers**: Volcano, KubeFlow Pipelines, Slurm for hybrid workloads
- **Storage**: High-speed SSD/NFS + object storage for datasets/models
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, NVIDIA DCGM, TensorBoard integration
- **Access Control**: IAM roles, namespace-level RBAC, audit logging

---

## Optimization Practices
- Mixed-precision training (FP16/BF16)
- Spot/preemptible instance usage for stateless batch jobs
- Model parallelism vs data parallelism trade-offs
- Caching of datasets and container images
- Auto-kill orphaned or failed long-running jobs

---

## Governance and Controls
- GPU/TPU policy management by workload type (e.g., production vs research)
- Quota enforcement and preemption policies
- Approval workflows for large-batch training runs
- Sustainability targets (e.g., emissions per training hour)
- Security scanning of ML containers and binaries

---

## Metrics of Success
- Average and peak GPU utilization per team
- Cost per training/inference hour (by workload type)
- Wait time to acquire GPU/TPU capacity
- % of unused/idle instance hours reclaimed
- SLA adherence for production inference jobs

---

## Summary
Effective GPU/TPU infra management underpins high-performing ML systems. With the right orchestration, scheduling, cost controls, and observability, platforms can maximize value from specialized hardware while ensuring reliability, fairness, and scalability.
