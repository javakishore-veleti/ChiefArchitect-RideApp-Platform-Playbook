# Integration with Core Product APIs

## Objective
Design reliable, secure, and scalable integration pathways between AI/ML systems and core platform APIsâ€”enabling real-time intelligence infusion into product features such as pricing, matching, fraud detection, personalization, and operations.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Embed ML insights directly into user and backend-facing product workflows
- Ensure latency, throughput, and resilience meet product-grade SLAs
- Simplify integration for model consumers across teams
- Standardize API contracts, monitoring, and access governance

---

## Integration Patterns
| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Synchronous Inference** | Real-time scoring during API calls (e.g., ETA, pricing) |
| **Asynchronous Scoring** | Batch predictions with job status polling (e.g., demand forecasts) |
| **Inline Feature APIs** | Unified access to online/offline feature stores |
| **Model-as-a-Service** | Expose models as REST/gRPC services with versioning |
| **Shadow Inference** | Silent prediction for monitoring or offline evaluation |

---

## Architecture Components
- **Gateway Layer**: API Gateway (Kong, Envoy) with rate limiting and auth
- **Inference Service**: Seldon, KFServing, TorchServe, Triton for scalable deployment
- **Feature Store**: Online (Redis, DynamoDB) and offline (Parquet, BigQuery)
- **Model Registry**: Track versions, tags, lineage, and promotion criteria
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog for traffic and model metrics

---

## Design Considerations
- Latency budget allocation per integration point
- Circuit breakers and retries for scoring fallbacks
- Canary rollout with traffic splitting
- Protocol standardization (e.g., JSON Schema, gRPC protobufs)
- Request tracing with correlation IDs across microservices

---

## Access Governance
- Role-based access to model APIs and data artifacts
- API key and token expiration policies
- Logging for usage, errors, and performance
- Service-level contracts between ML and product teams

---

## Testing and QA
- Contract testing with schema validation
- Synthetic request fuzzing for edge case coverage
- Golden set comparison for regression testing
- Traffic mirroring for model behavior under load

---

## Success Metrics
- P95 latency for inference requests
- Accuracy uplift of real-time vs static logic
- Uptime and SLA conformance per ML endpoint
- Time-to-integrate new model with product flow
- Reduction in manual model integration escalations

---

## Summary
Tightly integrated ML and product APIs unlock real-time, intelligent behaviors across the ride platform. With robust service infrastructure, testing pipelines, and cross-team SLAs, organizations can make ML a first-class citizen in customer and operational experiences.
