# ML Platform Architecture

## Objective
Design a scalable, secure, and self-service ML platform that empowers data scientists and ML engineers to experiment, train, deploy, and monitor models efficiently across the lifecycleâ€”from research to production.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Standardize ML workflows across teams with reusable components
- Enable reproducibility, auditability, and CI/CD for models
- Provide unified access to data, compute, and deployment infrastructure
- Reduce friction in deploying and governing ML models at scale

---

## Platform Layers
| Layer | Capabilities |
|-------|--------------|
| **Data Access Layer** | Connect to data lakes, warehouses, feature stores, governed access control |
| **Feature Engineering** | Real-time and batch feature pipelines, transformations, versioning |
| **Model Development** | Notebooks, IDE plugins, experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning |
| **Training Infrastructure** | On-demand distributed training (Spark, Ray, SageMaker, Vertex AI) |
| **Model Registry** | Versioned models, metadata tracking, approval workflows |
| **Inference Serving** | Online (gRPC/REST) and batch inference APIs, autoscaling |
| **Monitoring & Feedback** | SLA tracking, drift detection, usage dashboards, retrain triggers |

---

## Core Components
- **Feature Store**: Unified access to features used in training and serving (e.g., Feast, Tecton)
- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, Dagster for repeatable workflows
- **Model Registry**: MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, or custom tool
- **Serving Layer**: Seldon Core, KFServing, BentoML, or self-hosted REST/gRPC endpoints
- **Experiment Tracker**: MLflow, Weights & Biases for reproducibility
- **Metadata Store**: Tracks lineage, artifacts, parameters, environment info

---

## Integration with Platform Ecosystem
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Model promotion and rollback via GitOps (ArgoCD, Jenkins)
- **Security and Access**: IAM integration, secrets management, encryption
- **Data Privacy**: Masking, synthetic data support, opt-out enforcement
- **Observability**: Model metrics integrated with platform-wide dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana)

---

## Governance and Compliance
- Model cards describing purpose, data, assumptions, limitations
- Approval workflows for models affecting regulated domains (e.g., finance, safety)
- Audit trails for training, deployment, and inference events
- Role-based access to models and features

---

## Self-Service Enablement
- Templates to bootstrap new ML projects with golden paths
- SDKs and CLI tools for feature lookup, training, and deployment
- Searchable registry of existing models and experiments
- Training cost estimators and resource quota awareness

---

## Metrics of Success
- Time-to-train and time-to-serve new models
- Reuse rate of existing features and pipelines
- Mean time to detect and correct drift
- % of models in production with automated monitoring
- Uptime and SLA adherence of inference endpoints

---

## Summary
The ML platform is the foundation for reliable, repeatable, and scalable machine learning across the organization. It empowers teams to innovate with velocity while meeting production-grade requirements for traceability, performance, and compliance.
