# Data Annotation & Active Learning Workflows

## Objective
Build scalable, high-quality data annotation pipelines and integrate active learning loops to iteratively improve labeled datasets and model performance with minimal manual effort.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Ensure accurate, consistent labeled data for supervised learning tasks
- Prioritize labeling of ambiguous or high-value data points
- Leverage human-in-the-loop workflows efficiently
- Improve label coverage and quality over time through automation

---

## Annotation Use Cases
| Task | Examples |
|------|----------|
| NLP | Intent detection, sentiment, named entity tagging |
| CV | Object detection, image classification, bounding boxes |
| Time Series | Event labeling, anomaly span tagging |
| Multimodal | Chat + image sentiment, voice + text labeling |

---

## Pipeline Components
- **Annotation Tool**: Label Studio, Prodigy, Scale, Labelbox, Snorkel Flow
- **Task Queue**: Prioritized sample delivery to labelers (UI or external)
- **Label Store**: Versioned ground truth with metadata and provenance
- **Review Layer**: Consensus scoring, annotator disagreement detection
- **Audit Logs**: Full traceability of label origin and changes

---

## Active Learning Loop
1. Train initial model on seed labels
2. Rank unlabeled samples by uncertainty (entropy, margin, dropout variance)
3. Select diverse, high-uncertainty samples for labeling
4. Retrain model with expanded set
5. Repeat until convergence or performance plateau

---

## Quality Control Mechanisms
- Gold standard tasks with known labels
- Annotator scoring and skill-based routing
- Label fusion: majority vote, confidence-weighted averaging
- Drift checks on label consistency over time

---

## Integration with ML Stack
- Tie annotations directly to feature store and model registry
- Shadow training with new labels for offline performance eval
- Auto-trigger labeling on model confidence drops or error spikes

---

## Success Metrics
- Labeling throughput and latency
- Annotation agreement rate (inter-rater reliability)
- Model improvement per batch (accuracy/loss gain)
- % of total data labeled via active vs passive selection
- Reduction in re-labeling rate or error corrections

---

## Summary
Data annotation and active learning form the foundation for high-performing ML systems. With automated selection, human review loops, and tight integration into training workflows, platforms can scale supervision cost-effectively while improving quality over time.
