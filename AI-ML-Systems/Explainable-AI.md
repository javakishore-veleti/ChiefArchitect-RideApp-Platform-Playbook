# Explainable AI Tooling

## Objective
Develop and integrate explainability tools to interpret machine learning models, enabling transparency, trust, and actionable insights for internal stakeholders, regulators, and end users.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Clarify model behavior for debugging, trust, and fairness audits
- Support regulated use cases with interpretable output
- Enable decision-makers to understand AI predictions
- Improve data scientist productivity through rapid model diagnostics

---

## Types of Explainability
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Global** | Understand overall model logic and feature influence |
| **Local** | Explain a specific prediction (e.g., why this ride cost X) |
| **Model-Agnostic** | Works across tree, neural, ensemble models (e.g., LIME, SHAP) |
| **Model-Specific** | Built into the model (e.g., decision trees, linear models) |

---

## Tooling Options
- **SHAP**: Feature attribution, force plots, waterfall diagrams
- **LIME**: Local surrogate models for prediction explanation
- **Captum**: PyTorch explainability library (gradients, IG, etc.)
- **Alibi**: Anchors, contrastive explanations, adversarial detection
- **InterpretML**: Unified interface for classical and black-box models
- **Fiddler / Arize / WhyLabs**: Commercial explainability platforms with dashboards

---

## Platform Integration
- Embed local explanations in model inference API response
- Create UI overlays for model explanations in support or ops portals
- Enable drill-down from monitoring dashboards to SHAP values
- Store explanations alongside predictions for audit traceability

---

## Governance and Risk Controls
- Flag inconsistent or unstable feature contributions
- Monitor shifts in explanation distribution over time
- Highlight proxy features that may encode sensitive attributes
- Alert on missing explanations or explainability drift

---

## Use Cases
- Fraud model audit for rejection reasons
- Pricing transparency for surge justifications
- ETA outlier diagnostics using SHAP breakdown
- Internal experimentation comparisons with global attribution delta

---

## Success Metrics
- Time saved in debugging/triage with explanations
- Explanation fidelity (accuracy of surrogate models)
- User/agent trust rating on AI-supported workflows
- Reduction in support escalations due to unexplained decisions

---

## Summary
Explainable AI tooling enhances interpretability and accountability across ML workflows. With both local and global techniques, interactive dashboards, and governance hooks, it supports responsible AI delivery in regulated and trust-sensitive domains.
