# Anomaly Detection

## Objective
Develop robust, real-time and offline anomaly detection systems that monitor operational, behavioral, and transactional signals to detect outliers, fraud, system degradation, and emerging risks before they impact business performance.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Detect fraud patterns, suspicious user activity, and platform abuse
- Identify infrastructure or data quality issues proactively
- Improve trust by automating early alerts to users and ops teams
- Reduce cost of manual investigation and resolution

---

## Anomaly Detection Use Cases
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Financial | Payment spikes, refund loops, pricing inconsistencies |
| Operational | Drop in trip completions, surge misfires, demand outages |
| Behavioral | Driver route divergence, booking loops, multi-device usage |
| Infrastructure | Latency spikes, queue backlogs, error rate anomalies |

---

## Detection Techniques
- Statistical Methods (Z-score, IQR, control charts)
- Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet, STL decomposition)
- Machine Learning (Isolation Forests, One-Class SVMs)
- Deep Learning (Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, LSTMs)
- Hybrid Techniques (statistical thresholds + ML explainability)

---

## System Architecture
- **Streaming Layer**: Kafka + Flink for real-time event windowing
- **Batch Layer**: Airflow + Spark for nightly pattern discovery
- **Detection Engine**: Modular pipeline with plug-in algorithm support
- **Alerting System**: Prometheus + AlertManager + Slack/Email connectors
- **Explainability Tools**: SHAP, feature diffing, drift overlays

---

## Labeling and Feedback
- Human-in-the-loop for ambiguous or new patterns
- Incident triaging and tagging workflows
- Active learning for iteratively improving detection boundaries

---

## Governance and Thresholds
- Rule books with per-signal tolerances and escalation policies
- Alert deduplication, suppression, and silencing rules
- Audit logs for alerts and investigation actions
- Regional customization to minimize false positives

---

## Metrics of Success
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) anomalies
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR) after alert
- False positive and false negative rate per signal type
- % of anomalies caught before downstream impact
- Reduction in manual investigations needed

---

## Summary
Anomaly detection systems help keep the platform safe, efficient, and trustworthy. By combining streaming detection with explainability and feedback loops, they power proactive ops, early fraud control, and scalable risk mitigation across business domains.
