# SLO Enforcement Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define how Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are specified, enforced, and integrated across the RideShareApp Platform to ensure system reliability, improve engineering accountability, and enable proactive incident management.

---

## 1. Business Justification
- **Platform Reliability**: Guarantee availability and performance for core functions (e.g., booking, matching, pricing)
- **Feature Safety**: Catch regressions early during CI/CD rollout
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enable automated decision-making on canary rollbacks and scaling
- **Customer Trust**: Align engineering metrics with SLAs for riders, drivers, and B2B partners

---

## 2. SLO Types and Examples
| Domain            | SLI                      | SLO Target       | Measurement Tool     |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Booking API       | P95 latency              | < 300 ms         | Datadog + OpenTelemetry |
| Surge Engine      | Success rate             | > 99.9%          | gRPC Metrics Exporter |
| ETA Model Inference| Inference latency (P95) | < 450 ms         | Triton + Prometheus  |
| Driver Onboarding | Flow completion success  | > 95%            | Superset dashboard   |

---

## 3. Definition Process
- Every service must define:
  - 2–3 SLOs per domain (latency, availability, accuracy, etc.)
  - SLIs must be quantifiable and queryable
  - Error budgets established per quarter

- Stored in a central `slo-spec.yaml` alongside service code
- Reviewed quarterly with SRE, Product, and Domain Leads

---

## 4. Enforcement Mechanics
- **Pre-Deployment Checks**:
  - New PRs must include SLO impact notes if thresholds may change
  - Regression budget simulated in CI against staging data

- **Runtime Enforcement**:
  - Alert on error budget burn > 30% within a 7-day window
  - Block deploys if error budget exhaustion predicted
  - Rollbacks triggered via automated ArgoCD rollback hooks

---

## 5. Tooling Stack
- SLO Dashboards: Datadog, Nobl9 (error budget burn), Superset (domain SLOs)
- CI Integration: GitHub Actions plugin to query current SLO burn status
- Alerting: Slack + PagerDuty integration
- Policy as Code: OPA/Gatekeeper for budget-aware deployment policies

---

## 6. Engineering Governance
- Burnout reviews at biweekly domain reliability syncs
- Teams exceeding burn thresholds must:
  - Submit mitigation plan within 48 hours
  - Pause new feature rollout until remediation
  - Receive SRE/TPM sign-off for deploy reactivation

- SLO Violations logged for QBR (Quarterly Business Review) and engineering OKRs

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Auto-snapshot burn trends + deploy correlation across 20 services
- **Q3**: Integrate SLO spec validation as GitHub PR template requirement
- **Q4**: Predictive budget exhaustion alerts using LSTM-based forecaster

---

## Summary
The SLO enforcement strategy at RideShareApp bridges business outcomes with system reliability through measurable commitments, automated guardrails, and accountability rituals. This drives high-confidence innovation while maintaining user trust and operational excellence.
