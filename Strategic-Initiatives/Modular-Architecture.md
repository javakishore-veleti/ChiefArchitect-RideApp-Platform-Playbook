# Modular Architecture Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Design a modular architecture for the RideShareApp Platform that promotes team independence, reusability, scalability, and velocity across platform domains including rider flows, driver services, payments, fleet management, and partner integrations.

---

## 1. Why Modular Architecture?
- **Team Autonomy**: Parallel development of loosely coupled modules by dedicated domain teams.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Independent scaling, rollout, and upgrades of bounded context services.
- **Code Reusability**: Core libraries shared across similar domains (e.g., auth, logging, error handling).
- **Failure Isolation**: Prevent cascading issues by enforcing hard boundaries and timeout contracts.

---

## 2. Design Principles
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each module owns its business capability end-to-end (e.g., Booking, Pricing).
- **Explicit Interfaces**: APIs defined via OpenAPI/Protobuf contracts with versioning.
- **Domain Isolation**: No direct DB or code access across modules—communicate via events or APIs.
- **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual exposure of new logic within each module.
- **Contract Testing**: Enforce input/output expectations across module boundaries.

## 3. Module Types
| Module Name      | Description                                        | Example Owners          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Booking Service  | Rider-driver matchmaking + trip state machine      | Mobility Core Team       |
| Driver Identity  | KYC, licenses, earnings wallet                     | Driver Platform Team     |
| Pricing Engine   | Surge logic, fare breakdown                       | Demand Prediction Team   |
| Loyalty Module   | Rider tiers, credit earn/burn                     | Retention Engineering    |
| Fleet Tools      | Vehicle onboarding, telematics, health             | Fleet Ops + IoT          |

---

## 4. Platform-Oriented Contracts
- All modules expose:
  - REST/gRPC APIs with async webhook fallback
  - Versioned OpenAPI specs checked into Git repos
  - JSON schema for domain events in the event bus

- Contracts validated weekly via CI workflows using Pact or similar tools

---

## 5. Inter-Module Communication
- **Sync**: gRPC over Envoy mesh with retries and circuit breakers
- **Async**: Kafka topics or Pub/Sub queues for event-driven interactions
- **Shared Infra**: Feature store, auth service, observability agents

---

## 6. Observability & Governance
- Per-module SLIs (availability, latency, error rate)
- Dashboards auto-generated by tracing + metrics annotations
- Ownership mapping in service catalog (Backstage or Cortex)
- Security posture audits enforced at module boundaries (e.g., TLS, token scoping)

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Modularization of Payments, Driver, and Rider flows
- **Q3**: Launch API contract registry with consumer/provider matrix
- **Q4**: Enable dynamic version routing and module lifecycle dashboards

---

## Summary
Modular architecture enables the RideShareApp Platform to evolve rapidly, scale responsibly, and operate safely by encouraging decoupling, API-first design, and strict boundary management. It supports distributed teams and lays the foundation for long-term agility.
