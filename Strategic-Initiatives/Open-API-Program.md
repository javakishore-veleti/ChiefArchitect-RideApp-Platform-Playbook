# Open API Program

## Objective
Design and operate a secure, developer-friendly Open API program to enable external partners, platforms, and developers to build on top of the ride-hailing/delivery platform. This extends ecosystem reach, fosters innovation, and unlocks new revenue streams.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Empower partners (e.g., fleet owners, enterprise customers, mobility platforms) to interact programmatically with the platform
- Promote ecosystem innovation while protecting platform integrity
- Establish versioned, secure, and discoverable APIs for reuse
- Enable transparent documentation, sandbox access, and onboarding flows

---

## Target Consumers
| Consumer Type | Example Use Cases |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Partner Fleets | Vehicle onboarding, driver updates, availability status |
| Delivery Aggregators | On-demand dispatching, status updates, rating submission |
| Enterprise Customers | Scheduled rides, SLAs, billing integration |
| Public Sector | Accessibility APIs, sustainability metrics, city planning |

---

## API Categories
- **Booking & Scheduling**: Create, update, cancel ride requests
- **Vehicle & Driver Management**: Provisioning, updates, suspensions
- **Trip Lifecycle Events**: Status push/pull (e.g., assigned, en route, completed)
- **Billing & Payments**: Fare info, partner invoices, reconciliation APIs
- **Reports & Analytics**: Usage summaries, SLA metrics, feedback aggregation

---

## Developer Experience (DX)
- Public portal with OAuth2-based registration
- Developer dashboard for managing tokens, limits, and webhooks
- Auto-generated OpenAPI 3.0 specs with examples
- Postman collections and SDKs (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java)
- Sandbox environment with mock data for onboarding/testing

---

## Security & Governance
- API key and token management (JWT + OAuth2)
- Rate limits, IP whitelisting, usage tiers
- API versioning with sunset policies
- Audit logging, fraud detection hooks
- Partner-level access control and scopes

---

## Program Launch Plan
1. Internal alpha for partner-facing teams and controlled pilots
2. Closed beta with key partners under NDA and support
3. Public beta with self-service registration and monitoring
4. General availability with SLA, support tiers, and pricing model (if applicable)

---

## Metrics of Success
- Number of active registered partners
- API call volume and error rate
- Time to first successful call (TTFSC)
- Partner retention and usage breadth
- Revenue contribution from API-based services

---

## Summary
The Open API Program turns the platform into an extensible ecosystem. By standardizing APIs, simplifying onboarding, and enforcing strong governance, it enables safe and scalable third-party innovation that supports long-term growth and monetization.
