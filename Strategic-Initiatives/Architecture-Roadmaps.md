# Architecture Roadmaps – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish clear, phased architecture roadmaps that align the evolution of the RideShareApp Platform with business objectives, team capacity, and market shifts across infrastructure, data, AI, and developer experience domains.

---

## 1. Roadmap Structure
Each roadmap follows a structured format:
- **Themes**: Strategic goal categories (e.g., scalability, observability)
- **Phases**: Quarterly or half-year markers
- **Milestones**: Key delivery artifacts (e.g., module launch, infra rollout)
- **Dependencies**: Cross-team enablers
- **KPIs**: Technical and business impact tracking

## 3. Visualization Standards
- Roadmaps published as versioned markdown + PNG diagrams
- Each milestone has a Jira Epic + GitHub milestone link
- Status updated monthly via live dashboards

---

## 4. Governance
- Reviewed quarterly by Architecture Council
- Linked to Team OKRs and Program Increment (PI) plans
- Impact scoring across reliability, efficiency, and velocity

---

## 5. Summary
Architecture Roadmaps serve as the north star for RideShareApp Platform evolution—balancing tactical deliverables with long-term architectural health. By aligning with product strategy and engineering capacity, they ensure focus, traceability, and accountability across teams.
