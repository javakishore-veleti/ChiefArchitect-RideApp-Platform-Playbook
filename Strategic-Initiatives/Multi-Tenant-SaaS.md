# Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

## Objective
Enable the platform to operate as a scalable multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. This allows different fleets, partners, or cities to run logically isolated instances of the service on a shared infrastructure with strong tenant controls.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Support multiple tenants (partners, fleets, resellers) with secure data and config isolation
- Enable self-service onboarding and configuration at the tenant level
- Maintain economies of scale while offering customization
- Reduce operational overhead and avoid tenant sprawl

---

## Tenancy Models
| Model | Description | Applicability |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Shared Everything** | Logical separation at the app layer | Fast onboarding, cost-efficient |
| **Shared App, Separate DB** | Common codebase, tenant-specific databases | Moderate complexity and isolation |
| **Isolated Stack per Tenant** | Fully separated deployments | High-touch enterprise customers |

> The platform can evolve to support hybrid models based on customer tiers.

## Core Capabilities Required
- Tenant-aware authentication and authorization
- Per-tenant configuration and feature flags
- Usage metering and quota enforcement
- Namespace isolation for data, logs, events, metrics
- Per-tenant dashboards, alerts, and SLAs

---

## Data Isolation Patterns
- Database schema per tenant (PostgreSQL)
- Shared tables with `tenant_id` filter enforcement
- Encryption keys per tenant
- Event and metrics partitioning by tenant context

---

## Control Plane vs. Data Plane
- **Control Plane**: Tenant provisioning, access control, lifecycle APIs
- **Data Plane**: Actual ride booking, billing, fleet ops, etc.
- Clear interfaces to decouple global logic from tenant-specific execution

---

## Self-Service & Customization
- Admin portals for partners to manage branding, zones, pricing
- Configurable workflows and rules engines per tenant
- APIs to allow 3rd-party extensions or webhooks

---

## Operational Considerations
- Tenant health monitoring and SLA alerting
- Quarantine mode for noisy tenants
- Backups and disaster recovery per tenant
- Audit logs scoped to tenant admins and platform ops

---

## Metrics for Success
- Time to onboard a new tenant
- Number of active tenants per environment
- Cost per tenant vs revenue contribution
- Incidents per tenant per month

---

## Summary
Multi-tenant architecture unlocks scalable growth, operational leverage, and market segmentation. With the right patterns in place, the platform can offer flexibility and performance without compromising on security, compliance, or tenant isolation.
