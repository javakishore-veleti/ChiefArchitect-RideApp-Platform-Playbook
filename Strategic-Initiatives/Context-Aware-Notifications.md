# Context-Aware Notifications Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the architecture and logic for delivering timely, personalized, and context-aware notifications across the RideShareApp platform to enhance user experience, operational efficiency, and engagement.

---

## 1. Goals
- **Timeliness**: Ensure critical updates (e.g., trip changes, payment issues) are delivered instantly.
- **Relevance**: Filter and prioritize messages based on user behavior, location, and real-time system state.
- **Channel Intelligence**: Choose the right medium (push, SMS, email, in-app) per context and urgency.
- **Feedback Loop**: Adapt notification rules using ML signals and user preferences.

## 2. Notification Types
| Type                     | Example                                               | Channel(s)               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Transactional            | Trip accepted, ride canceled, OTP shared              | Push, In-App, SMS         |
| Operational              | Surge zone shift, ETA delay, payment declined         | In-App, Email             |
| Promotional              | Festival discounts, referral milestones               | Push, In-App, Email       |
| Behavior-triggered       | Rider dormant re-engagement, incomplete sign-up       | Email, Push               |
| Safety & Compliance      | Fatigue warning, unusual trip pattern alert           | In-App, Push              |

---

## 3. Contextual Signals
- **Location**: User GPS + surge zone intersection
- **Trip State**: Booking pending, ongoing, completed
- **Device State**: Battery %, Do Not Disturb mode, OS version
- **User Behavior**: Past dismissals, reaction time, open rate
- **System Conditions**: Cloud delay, high queue backlog, system health

---

## 4. Architecture Components
- **Notification Orchestrator**: Decides what, when, and how to notify
- **User Context Store**: In-memory store enriched with recent user activity & metadata
- **Channel Router**: Chooses delivery channel based on urgency and policy
- **Message Composer**: Personalizes and localizes content (i18n, dynamic tokens)
- **ML Signal Engine**: Predicts reaction likelihood and suppresses noise

---

## 5. Delivery Policies
- No more than 2 push messages per 30-minute window unless high-priority
- Promotions throttled to max 3 per week per user
- Fatigue prevention (auto-suppress for high opt-out users)
- Relevance score > 0.75 to trigger behavioral nudges

---

## 6. Logging & Observability
- All notifications logged with metadata (user state, context vector, delivery result)
- Delivery dashboard: per-channel success, click-through rates, bounce trends
- A/B test framework for template experimentation

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch real-time driver fatigue alerts with channel fallbacks
- **Q3**: ML-based suppression and urgency scorer rollout
- **Q4**: Context-aware promo engine with automated cohort targeting

---

## Summary
Context-aware notifications elevate the RideShareApp platform’s communication experience by delivering the right message to the right user at the right moment. This strategy ensures clarity, safety, and engagement without overwhelming users or degrading trust.
