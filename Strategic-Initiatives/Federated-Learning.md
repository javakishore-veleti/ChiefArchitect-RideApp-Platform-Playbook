# Edge Compute Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the strategic role of edge computing in the RideShareApp Platform to improve real-time responsiveness, reduce central latency, and support autonomous decisioning at city, fleet, and driver level.

---

## 1. Business Drivers for Edge Compute
- **Sub-Second Rider Experience**: Enable ultra-low-latency booking and ETA estimation for high-density metro areas.
- **Fleet & Vehicle Intelligence**: Perform driver behavior scoring, device health checks, and route prediction at edge nodes.
- **Resilient Operation**: Maintain booking and pricing functionality during transient cloud outages or poor connectivity zones.
- **Data Localization & Compliance**: Meet local regulations (e.g., GDPR, DPDP, regional cloud laws) by preprocessing at edge.

## 2. Edge Deployment Scenarios

| Use Case                        | Edge Location              | Benefits                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rider ETA Estimation           | Device + City Edge Node     | Reduced API round trips            |
| Dynamic Surge Pricing          | Metro Zone Gateway Node     | Local demand inference             |
| Fleet Monitoring               | On-Device (Driver App)      | Real-time alerts, lower latency    |
| Offline Booking Support        | Driver App Cache + Edge CDN | Fallback matching during outages   |
| Rider App Pre-Fetch            | Edge CDN + CloudFront       | Faster home screen load            |
| Location Anomaly Detection     | Local Kafka Stream          | City-based fraud triage            |

## 3. Edge Stack Components
- **Edge Nodes**: Micro-cloud appliances or metro-based regional cloud zones (e.g., AWS Wavelength, Akamai Edge)
- **On-Device SDK**: Thin clients embedded in Driver/Rider app (Rust or Kotlin)
- **Lightweight Models**: Quantized ONNX/TFLite models deployed via edge inference servers
- **Messaging Layer**: MQTT + gRPC Gateway for bidirectional communication
- **Edge Control Plane**: Central registry to sync models, config, policies, and updates

---

## 4. Governance and Management
- Each edge cluster must:
  - Auto-register to the central service mesh with metadata (region, uptime SLA, capacity)
  - Be observable via custom edge SLO dashboard (latency, message drop, cache hit rate)
  - Support remote logging and rollback of edge workloads

- Canary deployments validated via metro-specific traffic shadowing
- SLA policies defined per region (e.g., 99.9% response SLA for Tokyo, Bangalore zones)

---

## 5. Security Considerations
- Device attestation and certificate-based identity for edge agents
- End-to-end encryption between edge → cloud → app
- Firewall rules and regional ACLs for inbound traffic to edge zones
- Signed edge packages and firmware with periodic verification

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Edge node pilot in high-density metros (NYC, Bengaluru, Singapore)
- **Q3**: Offline matching + route prediction fallback during partial cloud outages
- **Q4**: Integrate edge ML model telemetry with model retraining loop

---

## Summary
Edge computing enables the RideShareApp Platform to enhance real-time reliability, elevate user experiences in high-load metros, and support regional compliance needs. This strategy balances cost, reach, and intelligence across the core cloud and decentralized edge surfaces.
