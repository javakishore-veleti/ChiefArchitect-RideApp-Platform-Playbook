# Partner Integration Model – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a standardized model for securely onboarding, integrating, and operating third-party partners—including payment gateways, fleet service providers, insurance platforms, and urban mobility systems—within the RideShareApp Platform.

## 1. Partner Categories
| Category               | Example Partners                   | Integration Type         |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Payments & Wallets     | Stripe, Razorpay, Paytm            | API (PCI-compliant)       |
| Fleet Management       | Leasing partners, EV platforms     | Webhooks + Data Sync      |
| Urban Transit Systems  | Public metro APIs, paratransit     | OAuth + Trip Handoff      |
| Safety & Insurance     | Insurtech, identity validators     | Synchronous APIs          |
| Loyalty & Offers       | Card-linked rewards, media bundles | Event Hooks + Embeds      |

## 2. Integration Lifecycle
1. **Partner Onboarding**
   - Identity verification, sandbox provisioning
   - Role, SLA, and data access scope defined

2. **API Contracting**
   - JSON schema for request/response
   - Signed SLO for latency, availability

3. **Staging Validation**
   - Partner test suite runs on simulated rides
   - Data masking and redaction enforced

4. **Production Go-Live**
   - Traffic shaping and token provisioning
   - Linked to ride events or pricing pipelines

5. **Ongoing Monitoring & Compliance**
   - Usage metering, incident alerting, audit trail
   - Privacy compliance (GDPR, DPDP)

---

## 3. Security & Data Handling
- All partner APIs pass through API Gateway with:
  - OAuth2 + JWT-based scoped tokens
  - Field-level PII redaction and encryption
  - Rate limits per partner category
- Sensitive event streams exposed via:
  - Kafka topics with RBAC filtering
  - Redacted webhook payloads
- Legal agreements define:
  - Data retention rules
  - Partner responsibility matrix

---

## 4. Tooling & Observability
- **Partner Dashboard**: Self-serve metrics, error logs, quota status
- **Event Tracker**: Partner visibility into rides, payments, and offers
- **Webhook Replay Tool**: For missed delivery replays with TTLs
- **Compliance Monitor**: Detects anomalies in usage, latency, or PII access

---

## 5. SLA Governance
| Partner Tier      | Latency Budget | Availability Target | Onboarding Time |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Gold Tier         | < 200ms        | 99.99%               | < 1 week         |
| Silver Tier       | < 400ms        | 99.9%                | < 2 weeks        |
| Basic Tier        | < 800ms        | 99.5%                | < 4 weeks        |

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch Insurance & Wallet API extensions with embedded observability
- **Q3**: Enable dynamic SLO enforcement per partner app category
- **Q4**: Launch partner sandbox orchestration and template onboarding kits

## Summary
The Partner Integration Model provides a secure, governed, and scalable approach for connecting external value-added services to the RideShareApp Platform. It balances velocity with control—unlocking new revenue streams, user experiences, and ecosystem value.
