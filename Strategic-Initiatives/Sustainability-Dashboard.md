# Sustainability Dashboard

## Objective
Build a Sustainability Dashboard to measure, monitor, and report on the environmental impact of platform operationsâ€”supporting transparency, regulatory compliance, and data-driven sustainability goals.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Track CO2 emissions, fuel usage, electric fleet adoption, and idle time
- Provide insights to fleet partners, city agencies, and sustainability officers
- Promote green usage patterns (e.g., ride pooling, EV routing)
- Enable ESG compliance reporting and voluntary disclosures

---

## Target Stakeholders
| Audience | Value Delivered |
|----------|------------------|
| Fleet Partners | Emission breakdowns, EV incentives, usage heatmaps |
| Internal Ops | Regional comparisons, idle/redundancy optimization |
| Public Sector | Aggregated footprint reporting, zone restrictions |
| Executive Team | ESG goal tracking, investor dashboards, carbon offset planning |

---

## Key Metrics and KPIs
- Total and per-ride CO2 emissions
- EV vs non-EV ride ratios
- Average fuel consumption (km/l, mpg)
- Idling time and emissions per zone or driver
- Pooling adoption rate
- Carbon offset equivalents

---

## Data Sources
- Telematics data from onboard units (OBUs) or mobile SDKs
- Vehicle type, fuel category, and trip metadata
- Partner fleet submissions (where applicable)
- 3rd-party emissions calculators or carbon APIs (e.g., Climatiq, CO2 Signal)

---

## Dashboard Views
- **Operations View**: Emissions by city, driver, fleet, time period
- **Partner Portal Widget**: Embedded dashboard for partners with SLAs
- **Executive View**: High-level ESG tracking for board and investor reporting
- **Public Snapshot (Optional)**: Aggregated, anonymized stats for public view

---

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Identify MVP metrics and validate data pipelines
2. Integrate carbon estimation APIs and calibrate formulas
3. Build reusable dashboard components (Grafana, Metabase, or custom)
4. Enable partner-level access with fine-grained data controls
5. Set baseline and track year-over-year improvement

---

## Governance and Compliance
- Auditability of emissions calculations
- GDPR compliance for location and usage data
- Transparency via open methodology docs
- Integration with sustainability frameworks (GRI, SASB, etc.)

---

## Summary
The Sustainability Dashboard is a critical step toward environmentally responsible platform operations. By turning trip and vehicle data into meaningful sustainability insights, it helps the business align with ESG mandates, support eco-conscious partners, and lead by example in sustainable urban mobility.
