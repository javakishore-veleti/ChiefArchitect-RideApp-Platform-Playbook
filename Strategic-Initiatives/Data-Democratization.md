# Data Democratization

## Objective
Enable secure, governed, and scalable access to data across teams, domains, and roles—empowering decision-making, experimentation, and product innovation without bottlenecks or compliance risk.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Treat data as a product: reliable, discoverable, and accountable
- Reduce dependency on data engineering bottlenecks
- Enable domain teams and PMs to self-serve validated data
- Enforce privacy, access control, and audit requirements by design

---

## Key Principles
| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Federated Ownership** | Each domain owns the quality, timeliness, and schema of its data products |
| **Data Mesh Ready** | Architecture supports decentralized pipelines and polyglot sources |
| **Governed Access** | Role-based controls, masking, PII tagging, and logs enforced centrally |
| **Discoverability** | Data catalog, lineage, and metadata documentation via portal or APIs |

---

## Personas and Use Cases
| Persona | Access Needs |
|---------|--------------|
| Product Manager | Analyze ride trends, feedback sentiment, incentive effectiveness |
| Data Scientist | Build ML models from historical trip and event data |
| Customer Ops | Look up trip logs, disputes, partner interactions |
| Executive | Monitor KPIs, adoption metrics, and unit economics by region |

---

## Platform Capabilities
- Central data lake with standardized ingestion contracts
- Stream/batch hybrid pipelines (Kafka + Airflow or equivalent)
- Pre-curated data marts for operations, growth, and finance
- Governed BI tooling (Looker, Superset, Metabase)
- Secure data sharing across domains and with partners
- Real-time data APIs for operational queries

---

## Enablement Tools
- Data Catalog and Metadata Registry (e.g., Amundsen, DataHub)
- Query sandbox environments with scoped access
- Data Contracts and versioned schemas
- Usage metrics and quality scoring dashboards

---

## Access and Governance
- Attribute- and role-based policies (ABAC + RBAC)
- Access request workflows integrated with Slack or Portal
- PII redaction, geo-based restrictions, encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit trails for every query or export

---

## Metrics of Success
- Time-to-data for new analysis (TTA)
- Number of active data product owners
- Query volume by persona and team
- % of insights reused across squads
- Compliance score (masking, access logging, tagging coverage)

---

## Summary
Data democratization unlocks speed and autonomy by aligning platform data with usability, governance, and compliance. It creates a scalable ecosystem where every team can explore, build, and decide with confidence—without compromising trust or integrity.
