# Experimentation and A/B Testing

## Objective
Establish a robust experimentation platform that enables data-driven product development through controlled testing, iteration, and measurement. The goal is to reduce decision risk, validate hypotheses, and optimize user experience across the platform.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Accelerate product innovation through experimentation at scale
- Empower teams to run safe, isolated, and measurable A/B tests
- Minimize blast radius through progressive rollouts
- Centralize experiment governance and reporting

---

## Use Cases
| Area | Sample Experiments |
|------|---------------------|
| Pricing | Dynamic discount strategies, surge models |
| UX | Button placements, messaging, color schemes |
| Routing | Provider ETA prediction models, route optimization logic |
| Offers & Incentives | Loyalty reward variations, referral value A/Bs |
| Admin Tools | Ops dashboard workflows, alert routing behaviors |

---

## Experiment Lifecycle
1. **Design**: Define hypothesis, metrics, audience, and duration
2. **Configuration**: Set up variants, sampling rules, segmentation logic
3. **Execution**: Allocate traffic, monitor test health, capture events
4. **Analysis**: View dashboards, calculate lift, validate statistical confidence
5. **Decision**: Promote, iterate, or sunset based on results

---

## Platform Features
- Central registry for experiments with metadata and ownership
- SDKs for mobile, web, and backend experiment targeting
- Stats engine for lift analysis, significance testing, and confidence intervals
- Integration with feature flags and rollout frameworks
- Guardrails: rollback on degradation, max exposure caps, audit logging

---

## Metrics and Reporting
- Conversion rate lift (absolute and relative)
- Retention or churn deltas by variant
- Operational cost impact per test (infra, support load)
- Time-to-decision cycle time
- Test exposure and segment penetration

---

## Governance Model
- Pre-launch review for all experiments impacting P0 flows
- Experiment expiration enforcement (no orphaned tests)
- Guardrails for minimum sample size and statistical rigor
- Central dashboards for visibility and learning reuse

---

## Tools and Stack Options
| Layer | Tooling |
|-------|---------|
| Experiment Registry | GrowthBook, Optimizely, Statsig, custom platform |
| Flag Management | LaunchDarkly, Flipt, Unleash, internal toggles |
| Analytics | Amplitude, Mixpanel, PostHog, Superset |
| Infra & SDKs | gRPC/REST APIs, language-specific SDKs, CI hooks |

---

## Summary
A culture of experimentation de-risks decision-making and promotes iteration grounded in evidence, not opinion. When tightly integrated into the development lifecycle, experimentation becomes a strategic advantage that powers continuous product and platform improvement.
