# Real-Time Decision Engines

## Objective
Design and integrate real-time decision engines to power intelligent, contextual, and time-sensitive platform behaviors such as pricing, dispatching, fraud prevention, and routingâ€”at scale and with low latency.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Enable dynamic, rule-based or ML-driven decisions under 100ms latency
- Separate decision logic from core service code for agility and auditability
- Incorporate contextual, streaming, and historical data into decision cycles
- Ensure observability and traceability of automated decisions

---

## Key Use Cases
| Domain | Decision Type |
|--------|---------------|
| Pricing | Surge multiplier, promotional discounts, fare caps |
| Dispatch | Driver selection, ETA prediction, zone routing |
| Fraud | Location anomaly detection, duplicate booking patterns |
| Loyalty | Reward issuance, gamified incentives, tier upgrades |
| Routing | Geo-optimization, traffic-aware re-routing, pooling logic |

---

## Architectural Patterns
- Stateless microservice endpoints for scoring decisions
- Pre-compiled decision policies with hot reload support
- Event-driven triggers from Kafka or event bus
- Sliding window aggregations via stream processors (e.g., Flink, Spark Structured Streaming)
- In-memory feature cache with TTL and fallback logic

---

## Technology Stack
| Layer | Tools & Frameworks |
|-------|---------------------|
| Stream Ingestion | Kafka, Pulsar, AWS Kinesis |
| Feature Engineering | Flink, Spark, DBT, Redis streams |
| Decision Engines | Open Policy Agent (OPA), Hummingbird, Drools, custom ML APIs |
| Feature Store | Feast, Redis, DuckDB |
| Low-Latency Storage | Redis, ScyllaDB, Cassandra |
| Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, custom rule logs |

---

## Governance and Ops
- Decision versioning and rollback (e.g., tagged rulesets or model IDs)
- Human override workflows for sensitive or edge-case scenarios
- Audit logs per decision with user impact tagging
- Simulation sandbox for A/B testing new rules/models

---

## Performance and SLAs
- Sub-100ms response time for 95%+ of decision calls
- Accuracy thresholds and alerting for rule/model drift
- Warm startup and autoscaling to match burst demand

---

## Metrics of Success
- Decision throughput and latency per service
- % of decisions overridden or flagged for review
- Uplift from decision personalization (CTR, conversion, revenue)
- Cost per 10K decisions vs baseline

---

## Summary
Real-time decision engines bring intelligence and agility into the core transactional fabric of the platform. By externalizing and optimizing this logic, the system evolves rapidly, adapts to signals instantly, and delivers personalized and efficient outcomes across business-critical workflows.
