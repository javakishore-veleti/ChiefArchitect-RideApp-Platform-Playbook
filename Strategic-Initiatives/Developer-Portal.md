# Developer Portal

## Objective
Establish a centralized Developer Portal to streamline internal and external developer onboarding, enable service discovery, consolidate documentation, and provide integrated tools for building and managing services across the ride platform.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Improve engineering efficiency by centralizing access to tools, APIs, and documentation
- Reduce onboarding friction for new developers, partners, and product teams
- Provide self-service capabilities to promote velocity and autonomy
- Create a single source of truth for architectural standards and assets

---

## Key Capabilities
| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **API Catalog** | Discoverable, searchable list of all internal and external APIs with versioning and documentation |
| **Service Registry** | Ownership, uptime, SLAs, health status of each deployed service |
| **Documentation Hub** | Central location for ADRs, playbooks, integration guides, onboarding manuals |
| **Developer Dashboard** | Real-time build/deploy/test status, usage metrics, open incidents |
| **CI/CD Tooling Links** | Quick access to pipelines, jobs, logs per project or repo |
| **API Token Management** | Generate, rotate, and audit access keys (internal and partner-facing) |

---

## User Types
| Role | Use Cases |
|------|-----------|
| Internal Engineer | Find APIs, understand service ownership, deploy new components |
| Partner Developer | Access OpenAPI specs, manage sandbox integrations, view rate limits |
| SRE | Monitor service SLAs, rollout state, and error trends |
| Product Manager | Explore feature APIs, test sandbox endpoints, view capability maps |

---

## Self-Service Features
- Create new service templates with golden paths
- Subscribe to service lifecycle events or SLA breaches
- Launch test environments via developer environments (DevSpaces)
- Automated dependency impact analyzer for breaking changes

---

## Integration Points
- GitHub / GitLab for source linking
- ArgoCD / Spinnaker for deployment visibility
- Prometheus / Grafana for observability integration
- API Gateway & AuthN layer for secure tokenized access

---

## Governance and Access Control
- Role-based access to visibility levels (e.g., public, internal, sensitive)
- Audit logs for documentation edits and token management
- ADR approval workflows

---

## Metrics for Success
- Time-to-onboard new developer or team
- Daily active users (internal and partner devs)
- Docs coverage by API or service
- Reduction in duplicated internal integrations

---

## Summary
The Developer Portal is the central nervous system of the engineering organization. By offering frictionless onboarding, transparency into services, and scalable self-service tooling, it reduces cognitive load and accelerates delivery across the platform.
