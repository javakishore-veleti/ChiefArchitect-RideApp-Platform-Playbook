# Offline Resilience Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a strategy to ensure service continuity and graceful degradation of the RideShareApp experience in offline or intermittently connected environments—across rider, driver, and operations interfaces.

---

## 1. Motivation
- **Driver Zones with Poor Connectivity**: Ensure that trip acceptance, location reporting, and trip completion still work in patchy networks (e.g., rural, underground).
- **Rider Reliability in Transit**: Maintain app usability when a rider is moving through weak signal areas (e.g., subways, tunnels).
- **Platform Resilience**: Avoid cascading failures or downtime due to edge unavailability or cloud service interruptions.

## 2. Offline-Aware Use Cases

| Component               | Offline Behavior                              | Sync Policy                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Driver App             | Cache trip queue, log GPS locally             | Sync every 10s when online          |
| Rider App              | Prefetch surge/fare + cache promo codes       | Refresh on next launch              |
| Booking Engine         | Edge fallback for match compute               | Flush to central queue on reconnect |
| Pricing Engine         | Snapshot surge rules to edge tier             | Time-based refresh via cron         |
| Operations Dashboard   | Last-seen vehicle cache view                  | Real-time fallback disabled         |

---

## 3. Core Design Principles
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Cache core flows (trip, fare, surge) using TTL logic
- **Edge Write-Ahead Queues**: Store writes locally until upstream channel is re-established
- **Conflict-Free Sync**: Leverage CRDTs or last-write-wins policies to handle retries
- **Local Model Scoring**: Deploy ONNX/TFLite variants for fallback inferences (ETA, pricing, fraud)

---

## 4. Enablers & Components
- **On-Device SQLite/Redis Cache**: Store config, stateful UI, trip queue
- **gRPC Retry Layer**: Implement backoff and quorum retry
- **Offline Feature Store**: Edge-extracted features for local ML scoring
- **Edge Control Plane**: Governs model TTLs, fallback policies, and snapshot refresh cadence

---

## 5. Security Considerations
- Encrypt offline trip data and cache with device-specific keys
- Secure logs against tampering until synced
- Token refresh when online to resume authenticated sessions

---

## 6. Testing and Validation
- Simulated network degradation using tools like Toxiproxy
- Chaos injection on edge → cloud sync paths
- Regression test battery for offline mode on app CI pipeline
- Edge vs cloud consistency reconciliation audit every deploy

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Enable trip completion + fare estimate in full offline mode for 5 pilot cities
- **Q3**: Roll out local ETA inference and cache-first fraud scoring to all edge clusters
- **Q4**: Support OTP, multi-rider config, and tip flows in low-connectivity

---

## Summary
Offline resilience is critical for global scale and trust in the RideShareApp platform. This strategy ensures continuity of essential workflows and model-backed decisions, even when cloud access is temporarily lost—enhancing user trust and operational independence.
