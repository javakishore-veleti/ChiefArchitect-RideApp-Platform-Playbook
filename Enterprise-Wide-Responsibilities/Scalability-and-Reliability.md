# Scalability and Reliability

## Objective
Ensure the platform is designed to scale horizontally and operate reliably under diverse and growing workloads, while maintaining consistent service levels and graceful degradation under failure conditions.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Design for growth in users, regions, and integrations without re-architecture
- Protect the customer experience through reliable APIs and graceful failover
- Minimize recovery time and prevent system-wide disruptions
- Embed failure awareness and observability into every layer

---

## Scalability Dimensions

### 1. **Traffic and Load Scalability**
- Horizontal autoscaling of stateless services via Kubernetes HPA
- Rate limiting, backpressure, and request prioritization
- Queue-based decoupling (Kafka/NATS) for burst traffic absorption

### 2. **Data Scalability**
- Polyglot persistence per domain (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Partitioning/sharding strategies for high-volume tables
- Time-series data offloading to analytical stores

### 3. **Geo and Multi-Tenant Scalability**
- Regional replication and edge node awareness
- Tenant-isolated resource pools or logical boundaries
- Global service discovery and configuration separation

---

## Reliability Strategies

### 1. **Resilience Patterns**
- Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, bulkheads
- Graceful degradation: fallback logic or UI downgrades
- Redundant replicas and AZ-aware deployments

### 2. **SLO-Driven Engineering**
- Define and enforce SLIs/SLOs per critical service
- Error budget tracking linked to deployment policies
- Alerting tied to customer-visible impact, not just system health

### 3. **Disaster Recovery and Failover**
- Region-level failover plans (active-active or active-passive)
- Backup frequency and automated restore testing
- Chaos engineering experiments to validate resilience

---

## Operational Practices
- Blue/green and canary release pipelines
- Load and stress testing integrated into CI/CD
- Service-level dashboards and incident heatmaps
- Playbooks for rollback, escalation, and customer communication

---

## Metrics and KPIs
- P95 and P99 latency across key APIs
- Error rate trends and recovery time (MTTR)
- Uptime percentage by tier (core vs. optional services)
- Capacity utilization vs. thresholds per node/group

---

## Summary
Scalability and reliability are not reactive capabilitiesâ€”they are designed upfront, measured continuously, and improved through practice. A platform that cannot scale or recover quickly puts the business at risk. This discipline safeguards customer trust and enables confident global expansion.
