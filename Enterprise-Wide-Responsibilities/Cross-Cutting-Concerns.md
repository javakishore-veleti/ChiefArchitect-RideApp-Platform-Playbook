# Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Objective
Establish foundational services and patterns that apply consistently across all domains and components of the platform—ensuring security, reliability, observability, and compliance are built into the platform by design.

---

## Key Cross-Cutting Capabilities

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- **Standards**: OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SSO (enterprise integrations)
- **Strategies**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- **Federation**: Identity provider integration (e.g., Google, Okta, AD)

### 2. Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus/Grafana for infrastructure and app-level metrics
- **Logging**: Structured, queryable, and trace-linked logs (Loki or ELK)
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- **Dashboards**: Predefined service-level views for engineering, SRE, and ops teams

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Centralized Management**: Dynamic config with versioning (e.g., Spring Cloud Config, Consul, etcd)
- **Secrets Management**: Secure key storage and rotation policies (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

### 4. Rate Limiting and API Quotas
- Throttling policies at gateway and service levels
- Tenant- or role-specific throughput limits
- Circuit breakers for downstream dependencies

### 5. Service Discovery and Routing
- Platform-managed DNS and service registry
- Support for blue/green and canary deployment routing
- Geo-routing and region-aware dispatch for scalability

### 6. Auditing and Compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs for key user/admin actions
- **Compliance Hooks**: GDPR tagging, PII redaction, deletion APIs
- **Security Posture Monitoring**: Periodic scans, drift detection, SBOM logging

### 7. Notifications and Communication
- Unified notification service for email, SMS, in-app messaging
- Extensible message templates and localization support
- Auditability and retry handling

---

## Design Principles
- **Reusable libraries and SDKs** for logging, telemetry, auth, and notifications
- **Guardrails, not gatekeepers**: enforcement through automation (CI/CD, GitHub Actions)
- **Tenant-aware and multi-region ready** services
- **Fail fast and degrade gracefully** patterns

---

## Implementation Approach
- Platform team owns base implementations; product teams extend via composition
- Consistent middleware for service mesh policies (mTLS, retries, timeouts)
- Shared responsibility for metrics and alerting coverage
- “Golden path” templates embedded into starter kits

---

## Summary
Cross-cutting concerns provide the **non-functional backbone** that keeps the platform secure, scalable, observable, and maintainable. A consistent foundation enables product teams to focus on business logic while inheriting robust operational behaviors.
