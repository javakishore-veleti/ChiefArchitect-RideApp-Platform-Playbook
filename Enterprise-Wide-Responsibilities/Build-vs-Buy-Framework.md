# Build vs Buy Framework – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a structured decision-making framework to guide whether to build internally or procure third-party solutions for components within the RideShareApp Platform, ensuring alignment with business goals, velocity, total cost of ownership (TCO), and risk profile.

---

## 1. Why This Matters
- **Strategic Focus**: Invest internal resources on core differentiators.
- **Speed to Market**: Leverage mature solutions where applicable.
- **Risk Management**: Assess vendor lock-in, supportability, and compliance risks.
- **TCO Awareness**: Quantify long-term build and maintenance costs.

## 2. Evaluation Criteria
| Dimension              | Considerations                                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Differentiation   | Is this a unique value driver for RideShareApp?                     |
| Time to Value          | Can external solutions accelerate delivery or MVP timelines?        |
| Ecosystem Fit          | Does it integrate cleanly with our stack, infra, and APIs?          |
| Total Cost of Ownership| Licensing + operational + training costs vs build cost              |
| Security & Compliance  | Does it meet data residency, GDPR, PCI, and SOC2 requirements?      |
| Vendor Maturity        | Stability, roadmap, support SLAs, and business viability            |
| Customization Needed   | Can external tool meet unique needs without brittle workarounds?    |

## 3. Decision Workflow
1. **Initiation**: Domain team proposes requirement + rationale
2. **Research**: Options assessment by product + architecture
3. **Scorecard**: Fill out Build-vs-Buy Evaluation Matrix
4. **Architectural Review**: Review with Principal Architect or ARB
5. **POC (if needed)**: 2–4 week side-by-side functional comparison
6. **Final Decision**: Approved build plan or procurement process initiation

## 4. Common Examples at RideShareApp
| Domain              | Decision   | Rationale                                      |
|---------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Observability Stack | Buy        | Industry standard (Datadog), low setup effort  |
| Surge Pricing Logic | Build      | Core IP requiring ML tuning and rollback       |
| Service Templates   | Build      | Tightly coupled to our platform conventions    |
| Notification Engine | Hybrid     | Vendor backbone + in-house orchestration layer |

---

## 5. Tooling
- **Scorecard Template**: YAML-based checklist included in `/Templates-and-References/Build-vs-Buy-Evaluation.yaml`
- **Decision Logs**: Stored in `Architecture-Decisions/` folder with rationale and revisit trigger
- **CI Check**: Warns if new services duplicate existing vendor-provided capability

---

## 6. Governance & Accountability
- Reviewed quarterly by Architecture Review Board (ARB)
- Business, legal, security, and SRE representatives participate in high-impact decisions
- All buy decisions must have an exit/rolloff strategy documented

---

## 7. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Scorecard automation and decision dashboard pilot
- **Q3**: Historical audit trail of all major build/buy decisions
- **Q4**: Benchmark library of past POCs and vendor evals

---

## Summary
The Build vs Buy Framework ensures RideShareApp makes deliberate, scalable, and financially sound decisions about its technology investments. By aligning engineering effort to strategic value, the platform maximizes speed, differentiation, and operational efficiency.
