# Service Mesh Adoption

## Objective
Introduce and govern a service mesh as a foundational layer for secure, observable, and policy-controlled service-to-service communication in the platform. The service mesh should enhance resilience and security without increasing application-level complexity.

---

## Strategic Rationale
- Decouple networking concerns from application logic
- Standardize observability, mTLS, retries, and routing rules
- Improve security posture without modifying service code
- Enable zero-trust networking between services

---

## Key Benefits
| Area | Value Provided |
|------|----------------|
| **Security** | Mutual TLS (mTLS), service identity, encryption in transit |
| **Observability** | Standard metrics, distributed tracing, access logging |
| **Traffic Control** | Canary, blue/green deploys, traffic shifting by headers or version |
| **Reliability** | Retries, circuit breakers, timeouts, outlier detection |
| **Policy Enforcement** | RBAC/ABAC at mesh layer, rate limiting, failover behavior |

---

## Target Use Cases
- Gradual rollout of new versions with traffic splitting
- Enforcing zero-trust networking with identity-based policies
- Unified tracing and metrics collection across heterogeneous services
- Simplified blue/green deployments in a multi-tenant environment

---

## Recommended Mesh Technologies
| Tool | Context |
|------|---------|
| **Istio** | Enterprise-grade features, extensibility, rich ecosystem |
| **Linkerd** | Simpler, performance-focused, operationally light |
| **Consul Connect** | Strong for hybrid VM/K8s mesh use cases |

> The selected mesh should integrate with existing Kubernetes and observability stacks.

---

## Design and Adoption Plan
1. **Pilot Phase**
   - Enable mesh sidecars for a limited set of non-critical services
   - Validate latency overhead, logging, security enforcement

2. **Progressive Rollout**
   - Expand by service domain and team readiness
   - Configure gateway proxies and ingress policies

3. **Full Mesh Enablement**
   - Mesh-wide policy enforcement (e.g., mTLS required)
   - Integrate with SSO and service discovery systems
   
4. **Ops Readiness**
   - Mesh observability dashboards
   - On-call runbooks for routing/policy debugging

---

## Governance & Maintenance
- Version compatibility with Kubernetes clusters
- Mesh configuration as code (Helm/ArgoCD)
- Automated policy testing and regression detection
- Platform team ownership with team opt-in model

---

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Operational complexity | Start small, provide templates, automate onboarding |
| Debuggability | Mesh observability stack + developer tooling support |
| Resource overhead | Monitor sidecar cost, consider ambient mesh if needed |

---

## Summary
A service mesh is a key enabler of secure, reliable, and observable microservice communication. When adopted incrementally and governed with clarity, it becomes a foundational pillar for platform resilience, deployment agility, and zero-trust enforcement.
