# Internal Platform Development – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define strategy, principles, and operational processes to evolve RideShareApp’s internal developer platforms as a product—focusing on automation, reusability, velocity, and service quality across the engineering organization.

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision
- **Platform-as-a-Product**: Treat platform teams as product teams with internal users.
- **Abstract Repetition**: Reduce cognitive load and engineering toil through reusable patterns.
- **Shift-Left Enablement**: Move security, observability, and compliance earlier in the lifecycle.
- **Delivery Autonomy**: Empower feature teams to deploy independently with safety and guardrails.

## 3. Tech Stack Components
- **Scaffolding**: Cookiecutter, Backstage plugins
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform Cloud
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault + SPIRE
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo
- **Policy as Code**: OPA Gatekeeper, Rego rules
- **Platform Registry**: Internal service metadata + ownership

---

## 4. Operating Model
- **Platform Teams**: Own capability domains (CI/CD, Security, Observability)
- **Product Managers**: Prioritize features based on internal user feedback
- **Support Channels**: Slack triage bot, monthly office hours, internal roadmap site
- **Feedback Loops**: Periodic surveys, incident retro feedback, developer NPS

---

## 5. Governance
- **Service Maturity Levels**: Tiers (Bronze → Gold) tied to platform adoption
- **Readiness Gates**: Required platform integration checklists for go-live
- **Change Advisory Board (CAB)**: Reviews breaking platform API changes

---

## 6. Roadmap Highlights
- **Q2**: Launch Backstage Developer Portal MVP + CLI tool bootstrap
- **Q3**: SLO-aware CI/CD pipeline upgrades + Vault v2 rollout
- **Q4**: Platform-wide service maturity scorecard dashboard

---

## Summary
Internal platform development is foundational to the scalability and velocity of the RideShareApp Platform. By investing in self-service, golden paths, and developer-first tooling, this strategy creates leverage across all product domains while maintaining security and operational excellence.
