# Architecture KPIs and Metrics – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish quantifiable architectural KPIs and metrics that align with the RideShareApp Platform’s goals of reliability, scalability, developer velocity, cost-efficiency, and compliance. These metrics help track the platform's architectural health and guide strategic decision-making.

### d) **Platform Security & Compliance**
| Metric                          | Description                                       | Target               |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Secrets Rotation Compliance    | % of secrets rotated per policy SLA               | 100% (monthly or 90-day) |

## 2. Dashboards & Alerting
- All metrics exposed via Prometheus → Grafana + Datadog dashboards
- Alerts configured for SLA breaches, regression spikes, or pipeline failures
- Weekly KPI health check email to platform engineering leadership

---

## 3. Governance and Ownership
- KPIs owned at the **domain service level**
- Architecture Council reviews scorecards **quarterly**
- Dashboards linked in Confluence + GitHub README of each core repo

---

## 4. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch unified KPI schema and registry
- **Q3**: SLI → KPI correlation mapping for incident postmortems
- **Q4**: Cost-to-impact modeling dashboard across fleet, AI, and data layers

---

## Summary
The Architecture KPI and Metrics strategy brings transparency and accountability to the RideShareApp Platform’s engineering foundation. It helps teams make data-driven architectural decisions and improves platform-wide observability, cost control, and reliability.
