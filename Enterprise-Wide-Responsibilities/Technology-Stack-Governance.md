# Technology Stack Governance

## Objective
Define, standardize, and govern the technology stack that underpins all platform servicesâ€”ensuring scalability, security, maintainability, and alignment with business and engineering strategy.

---

## Goals of Technology Stack Governance
- Enable consistency and interoperability across services
- Promote reuse through well-defined language and framework boundaries
- Reduce cognitive load and onboarding time for new engineers
- Ensure alignment with platform SLOs, compliance, and cost goals
- Prevent tech sprawl and reduce long-term operational risks

## Governance Framework Components

### 1. Approved Technology Stack
Establish an approved set of tools, languages, frameworks, and platforms categorized by maturity:

| Category | Adopt | Trial | Assess | Hold |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|------|
| Languages | Java, Kotlin, TypeScript | Go, Python | Rust | PHP, Ruby |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes, ArgoCD | ECS | Nomad | Docker Swarm |
| API Gateways | Kong, Envoy | Gloo | Tyk | NGINX custom proxies |
| Observability | Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry | SigNoz | Lightstep | ELK (for new use) |
| Infra-as-Code | Terraform, Helm | Pulumi | Crossplane | Manual provisioning |

> Stack changes require RFCs and architectural review board approval.

### 2. Language and Framework Standards
- Backend: **Java** (domain services), **Kotlin** (modern services), **Go** (infra), **Python** (ML/data)
- Frontend/BFF: **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js**
- Frameworks: **Spring Boot**, **Express.js**, **FastAPI** (lightweight)

### 3. Governance Roles
- **Architecture Council**: Final approval authority on stack changes
- **Platform Teams**: Maintain golden paths and starter templates
- **Service Owners**: Submit RFCs for deviations or new proposals

### 4. Documentation and Transparency
- Maintain a **Tech Radar** and **Component Catalog**
- Require ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for all exceptions
- Track tool adoption trends and usage deprecation schedules

## Tech Evaluation Criteria
When introducing new technologies:
- Proven community and long-term support
- Integration with existing observability and security stacks
- License suitability and legal review
- Maintenance overhead and operational cost
- Alignment with team skillsets and hiring capabilities

---

## Stack Governance Processes
- Quarterly stack review cycles
- Pre-merge tooling checks (e.g., lint, SAST, dependency license scan)
- RFC process for new tech adoption or deprecated tech replacement
- Gatekeeping via GitHub Actions and CI policy enforcement

---

## Summary
Technology Stack Governance acts as the backbone for consistent, safe, and productive development across the platform. It empowers developers to move fast within guardrails while ensuring long-term maintainability, business compliance, and technical scalability.
