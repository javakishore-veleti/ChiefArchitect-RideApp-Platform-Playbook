# Technical Debt Management – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Implement a systematic and measurable framework for identifying, categorizing, prioritizing, and remediating technical debt across the RideShareApp Platform to ensure sustainable velocity, platform reliability, and architectural integrity.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- **Platform Scalability**: Unchecked tech debt slows onboarding, scaling, and resilience.
- **Developer Experience**: Improves engineering morale and reduces context switching.
- **Feature Velocity**: Minimizes regressions and system fragility.
- **Auditability**: Critical for compliance readiness and incident response.

## 2. Categories of Technical Debt
| Type              | Description                                         | Example                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Code Debt         | Poorly structured, outdated, or duplicated logic    | Monolithic controller with side effects |
| Architecture Debt | Violated boundaries, tight coupling                 | Shared DB across unrelated services     |
| Process Debt      | Missing tests, docs, review cycles                  | No integration tests for surge engine   |
| Infrastructure    | Legacy deployment flows, outdated libraries         | Deprecated container base images        |
| Data Debt         | Unmodeled edge cases, PII mixing                    | Improper null handling in trip logs     |

## 3. Governance Process
- **Debt Register**: Central YAML/JSON repo by module with:
  - Debt description, owner, impact severity, estimated cost
- **Scoring Framework**: Evaluate based on:
  - Blast radius, engineering overhead, security impact
- **SLAs**:
  - Critical: Remediate in < 30 days
  - High: Remediate in < 60 days
  - Medium: Planned in next 1–2 quarters
  - Low: Review annually
- **Debt Reviews**:
  - Quarterly cross-team review board chaired by platform architects
  - Roadmap linked to OKRs for long-term cleanup

---

## 4. Tooling & Metrics
- **Tech Debt Linter**: Static analysis (e.g., SonarQube) with custom rules
- **Code Coverage Heatmaps**: Identify under-tested modules
- **GraphQL/REST Drift Scanners**: Detect unused or stale APIs
- **Build-Time SLAs**: Alert if known debt files are edited without remediation note

---

## 5. Incentives & Culture
- **Tech Debt Fix Fridays**: Company-wide 10% time allocation each month
- **Debt Hero Leaderboard**: Score visible contributions to cleanup
- **Sprint Hygiene**: At least one cleanup story per team per sprint
- **Debt Ownership Tags**: Named maintainers for key modules

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch debt register and integrate SonarQube into PR checks
- **Q3**: Automate stale dependency flagging across microservices
- **Q4**: Introduce debt backlog burn-down visualization in dashboards

## Summary
Technical debt, if unmanaged, compounds into systemic fragility. RideShareApp’s proactive and structured debt management strategy ensures that innovation is built on a clean, safe, and maintainable foundation—empowering developers and prote
