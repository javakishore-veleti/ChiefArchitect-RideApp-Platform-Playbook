# Organizational Architecture

## Objective
Design an organizational structure that aligns with the platform's technical architecture, promotes ownership, accelerates delivery, and supports long-term scalability through clear domain boundaries and responsible autonomy.

---

## Strategic Alignment Goals
- Ensure platform domains map to team boundaries (Conwayâ€™s Law)
- Foster autonomy with accountability for SLAs, quality, and delivery
- Avoid central bottlenecks while maintaining architectural cohesion
- Enable rapid growth and onboarding through modular team structures

---

## Team Topologies

### 1. **Stream-Aligned Teams**
- Aligned with customer journeys or business capabilities (e.g., Rider Services, Driver Lifecycle, Partner APIs)
- Responsible for delivery, maintenance, and evolution of their domains

### 2. **Platform Teams**
- Build internal tools, SDKs, CI/CD templates, observability frameworks
- Own infrastructure, DevEx, shared service templates, SRE practices

### 3. **Enabling Teams**
- Short-term rotation to upskill product teams on new tech (e.g., eventing, ML, data modeling)
- Develop internal training and knowledge base

### 4. **Complicated Subsystem Teams**
- Focused on specialized systems like dynamic pricing, routing algorithms, ML inference pipelines
- Provide reusable APIs to stream-aligned teams

## Role Definitions

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Chief Architect | Vision, cross-domain cohesion, governance frameworks |
| Domain Architect | Service design, team coaching, tech radar participation |
| Engineering Manager | Delivery, staffing, sprint health, performance |
| Product Manager | Roadmap, requirements, customer feedback loop |
| SRE/Platform Engineer | Reliability, automation, observability enablement |

---

## Governance Without Bottlenecks
- **Architecture Review Board**: Lightweight async proposal process
- **Technical RFCs**: Required for major design changes, versioning plans, external integrations
- **Golden Path Templates**: Reduce variance while enabling speed
- **Internal Docs and API Catalogs**: Discoverability of shared assets

---

## Onboarding and Knowledge Sharing
- Domain-specific onboarding plans
- Internal wikis per stream-aligned team
- Cross-team demos and learning hours
- Architecture office hours and platform deep dives

---

## Success Metrics
- Cycle time and deployment frequency per team
- Internal platform adoption rate
- Cross-team dependency reduction trend
- Engineering satisfaction scores and attrition metrics

---

## Summary
A high-functioning organizational architecture allows platform growth to scale with people, without eroding delivery quality or decision clarity. Teams own what they build, extend what they depend on, and trust in platform foundations to enable continuous innovation.
