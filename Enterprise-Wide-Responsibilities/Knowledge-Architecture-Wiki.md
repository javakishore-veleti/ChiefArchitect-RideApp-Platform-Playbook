# Knowledge Architecture Wiki – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a structured, scalable, and discoverable knowledge architecture system that ensures cross-team documentation, tribal knowledge, and architectural decisions are easily accessible and maintained across the RideShareApp Platform.

---

## 1. Why It Matters
- **Onboarding Efficiency**: Reduce ramp-up time for engineers, PMs, and designers.
- **Cross-Team Alignment**: Ensure shared understanding of domain models and interfaces.
- **Decision Traceability**: Track the rationale behind architectural choices.
- **Operational Readiness**: Make playbooks, SOPs, and escalation protocols accessible.

## 2. Core Knowledge Types
| Type                        | Examples                                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Architecture Decisions      | ADRs, trade-off discussions, deprecation notices          |
| Service Documentation       | API specs, ownership, observability dashboard links       |
| Domain Models               | Event flows, entity relationships, boundary diagrams      |
| Operational Playbooks       | Incident runbooks, scaling SOPs, on-call checklists       |
| Business Capability Maps    | Capability → system mapping for executive stakeholders    |
| Strategic Initiatives       | Program charters, OKRs, quarterly goals                   |

## 3. Wiki Architecture
- **Folder Taxonomy**: Aligned with platform structure
  - `/domains/<booking|pricing|fraud>/` → Domain artifacts
  - `/infra/` → CI/CD, observability, infra-as-code docs
  - `/platform/` → Design principles, cross-cutting capabilities
- **Naming Convention**: `Area--Subarea--Version.md` (e.g., `Booking--TripFlow--v2.md`)
- **Status Tags**: DRAFT | APPROVED | DEPRECATED
- **Linked Index**: Central `_SUMMARY.md` to auto-link folders/files

---

## 4. Tooling & Integration
- **Source of Truth**: GitHub Wiki or Markdown + Docs-as-Code repo
- **Live Search**: Algolia/DocSearch integration
- **Contributor Guide**: Lint rules for file names, folder depth, link hygiene
- **Templates**: YAML-based templates for ADRs, service pages, domain overviews

---

## 5. Governance & Maintenance
- **Documentation Champions**: Named per team or domain
- **Quarterly Wiki Health Reviews**: Track stale content, orphan pages
- **Slack + GitHub Hooks**: Notify changes to core wiki areas
- **Review Checklists**: Wiki completeness as part of service go-live checklist

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch Docs-as-Code pipeline and auto-linting in PRs
- **Q3**: Migrate tribal Notion/Confluence pages into wiki format
- **Q4**: Introduce versioning support and changelog diff viewer

---

## Summary
The Knowledge Architecture Wiki provides a sustainable and discoverable foundation for RideShareApp’s institutional memory. It aligns teams, accelerates decision-making, and empowers contributors across the engineering and product ecosystem to build with clarity and confidence.
