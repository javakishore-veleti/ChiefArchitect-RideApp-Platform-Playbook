# Rate Limiting and Throttling – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a robust rate limiting and throttling strategy for the RideShareApp Platform to protect internal and external services from abuse, prevent cascading failures, and provide fair resource usage across tenants, geographies, and device types.

---

## 1. Why Rate Limiting Matters
- **Protect shared infrastructure** (e.g., Redis, Kafka, DB pools) from spikes
- **Ensure fair use** across enterprise partners and power users
- **Defend against abuse** (bot traffic, promo exploitation, brute force)
- **Stabilize mobile app behavior** in degraded network or retry storms

## 2. Types of Rate Limits in RideShareApp
| Type                     | Scope                         | Use Case Example                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Global API Limit         | Platform-wide per endpoint    | `/v1/trips/book` limited to 2000 RPS globally           |
| Per-User Limit           | Rider or driver ID            | Max 10 trip cancels/hour per user                      |
| Tenant-Aware Limit       | Partner/Fleet ID              | 100 RPS per enterprise fleet for dispatch API          |
| Device-Type Limit        | Mobile vs Web                 | Reduce background refresh on mobile apps               |
| Geo/Region-Based Limit   | Per-city or country           | 200 RPS for surge pricing updates in New York          |

## 3. Throttling Strategies
- **Soft Throttling**: Return HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` with Retry-After header
- **Hard Throttling**: Drop traffic after strict quota breach with circuit-breaker fallback
- **Token Bucket** (burst-friendly) and **Leaky Bucket** (steady rate) implementations
- Gradual backoff: `1x`, `2x`, exponential or jitter-based

---

## 4. Infrastructure Tools
- **API Gateway (Envoy/Istio)**:
  - Global endpoint-level enforcement
  - JWT/tenant-based rate limits using policy annotations
- **Redis-based Limiters**:
  - Fine-grained user/device quotas using sliding window or token bucket
- **Kafka Consumers**:
  - Per-consumer group throttles with batch size and lag monitor
- **Async Queue Guardrails**:
  - Limit payload processing per queue to prevent DLQ saturation

---

## 5. Governance & Monitoring
- Rate limit config per service must be declared in the service Helm chart
- All limits reviewed by platform SRE before production rollout
- Prometheus/Grafana metrics: `429_count`, `rate_limit_violations`, `retry_after_latency`
- Alert if:
  - More than 5% of requests per minute are throttled
  - Tenants exceed agreed quota 3 times in 24 hours

---

## 6. Developer Experience
- Developer portal must expose current rate limits by tier/plan
- SDKs return clear `RateLimitExceededException` with retry hints
- Test harnesses to simulate load against pre-prod limits

---

## Summary
Rate limiting and throttling are essential tools for RideShareApp Platform reliability, scalability, and fairness. By enforcing adaptive limits across multiple axes—users, tenants, regions—we protect backend services, improve customer experience, and avoid noisy neighbor risks.
