# Sharding and Partitioning Strategies – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define scalable sharding and partitioning strategies across the RideShareApp Platform to ensure horizontal scalability, low-latency access, fault isolation, and operational efficiency of critical domain data (trips, driver states, incentives, payments).

---

## 1. Why Sharding and Partitioning Matter
- **Scale Out**: Handle growth in trips, drivers, and events across geographies.
- **Hotspot Mitigation**: Avoid write/read bottlenecks for high-frequency updates (e.g., live driver location).
- **Tenant Isolation**: Support enterprise partners with logical data isolation per fleet or region.
- **Compliance**: Meet region-specific data residency policies (e.g., GDPR, India data localization).

## 2. Sharding Strategy by Domain
| Domain            | Shard Key                     | Store              | Notes                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Trip Records      | `region_id`                   | PostgreSQL         | Aligns with surge pricing & dispatching  |
| Driver Profiles   | `driver_id % shard_count`     | MongoDB            | Even distribution across nodes           |
| Location Streams  | `driver_id` → Kafka partition | InfluxDB + Kafka   | Partitioned streams per driver           |
| Incentive Logs    | `driver_id`                   | BigQuery           | Sharded tables for payout summaries      |
| ML Feature Store  | `trip_type + time_window`     | DeltaLake          | Time-bucketed + feature group tags       |

## 3. Partitioning Best Practices
- Use **time-based partitioning** for append-heavy domains (e.g., location, payments)
- Use **region or tenant-based partitioning** for latency-sensitive reads (e.g., booking UI)
- Avoid over-partitioning (e.g., hourly for data accessed daily)
- Enable **auto-expiry policies** on partitions older than 6–12 months (compliance + cost control)

---

## 4. Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Using UUIDs as primary shard keys — poor locality, no partition pruning
- ❌ Multi-attribute composite keys that change frequently
- ❌ Putting transactional and analytical data in the same DB shard

---

## 5. Cross-Shard Access Considerations
- Use **API gateways** or **federated query planners** to aggregate across shards
- Centralize **shard routing metadata** in service discovery (e.g., booking-service looks up region routing)
- Apply circuit breakers and rate limits per shard to contain blast radius

---

## 6. Governance
- Shard ownership defined in `shard-topology.yaml` and published in Backstage
- Schema migrations require testing against multi-shard staging environments
- Platform tooling supports shard-aware batch processing and backfills
- Sharding decisions must be documented in ADRs with key-space design and growth projections

---

## Summary
RideShareApp Platform's data scaling strategy hinges on intelligent sharding and partitioning. Domain-aligned keys, time-bound partitions, and shard-aware processing ensure system resilience, developer clarity, and cost-effective growth across the platform.
