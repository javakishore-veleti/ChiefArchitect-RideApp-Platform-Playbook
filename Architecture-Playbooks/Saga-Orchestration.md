# Saga Orchestration – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Implement Saga orchestration patterns across the RideShareApp Platform to handle distributed transactions that span multiple microservices, ensuring consistency without using global database locks—especially for complex, long-lived workflows such as trip booking, payment reconciliation, and driver deactivation.

---

## 1. Motivation for Sagas in RideShareApp
- Avoid tight service coupling across Booking, Payments, Driver Identity, and Incentives domains
- Enable fine-grained compensation workflows (e.g., refund trip, revoke bonus, release driver allocation)
- Improve resiliency with async rollback support when part of the workflow fails

---

## 2. Saga Types
- **Orchestrated Saga (preferred)**:
  - Central Saga Orchestrator coordinates steps using a defined DSL or engine
  - Easier to visualize, monitor, and enforce business rules

- **Choreographed Saga**:
  - Steps are coordinated via pub/sub events without a central controller
  - Used for simpler flows like email notification triggers or analytics events

## 3. Core RideShareApp Sagas
| Saga Workflow            | Participating Services                          | Compensation Actions                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Trip Booking             | Rider, Trip, Driver, Pricing, ETA, Payments     | Cancel trip, refund payment, release driver  |
| Driver Offboarding       | Identity, Incentives, Support                   | Re-enable account, restore bonus history     |
| Partner Onboarding       | Partner API, KYC, Billing, Dashboard Provisioning | Rollback user access, cancel billing setup  |
| Refund Processing        | Payments, Ledger, Trip, Support UI              | Void ledger entry, mark trip unresolved      |

## 4. Saga Orchestrator Design
- **Platform Tooling**:
  - Temporal.io for workflow definitions, retry strategies, and compensation routing
  - State saved in workflow history for debuggability
- **Retry Semantics**:
  - Exponential backoff on non-idempotent steps (e.g., `driver-assign`)
  - Compensating steps invoked on saga failure or timeout
- **Audit and Observability**:
  - Each Saga instance has a trace ID and duration SLA
  - Saga event logs exported to BigQuery + Grafana

---

## 5. Saga Definition Example – Trip Booking
```yaml
saga_name: trip-booking-saga
steps:
  - name: ReserveDriver
    service: driver-matcher
    compensation: ReleaseDriver

  - name: LockFare
    service: pricing-engine
    compensation: UnlockFare

  - name: ProcessPayment
    service: payment-service
    compensation: RefundPayment

  - name: ConfirmTrip
    service: trip-service
```

---

## 6. Governance and Best Practices
- All new critical workflows that involve more than 2 domain services must be implemented as a saga
- Compensation logic must be unit-tested independently
- Sagas must be observable via centralized tracing (Jaeger/Tempo)
- Use event versioning and schema contracts to isolate changes across saga participants

---

## Summary
Saga orchestration is central to RideShareApp’s strategy for reliable, distributed business processes. By using orchestrated sagas, we ensure operations like booking, refunds, and identity deactivation are resilient, reversible, and traceable without tight coupling between domain services.
