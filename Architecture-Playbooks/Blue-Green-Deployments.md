# Blue/Green and Canary Deployments – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define safe and resilient deployment strategies using **Blue/Green** and **Canary Deployments** for RideShareApp Platform services. These approaches minimize downtime, reduce blast radius, and support real-time rollback during critical updates across backend APIs, rider/driver apps, and ML pipelines.

---

## 1. Use Case Rationale
- Release new fare calculation logic without disrupting active trips
- Upgrade surge pricing models only in selected regions first
- Validate new driver onboarding workflows on a small user cohort
- Hotfix rollout with instant switchback capability

---

## 2. Blue/Green Deployment in RideShareApp
### Process:
- Maintain two production environments: `Blue` (live) and `Green` (staging-to-prod candidate)
- Route 100% traffic to Green post-validation, then deprecate Blue
- Ideal for stateless microservices and feature-complete releases

### Scenarios:
- Rider notification system overhaul
- Trip dispatch algorithm upgrade

### Implementation:
- Managed via Argo Rollouts / Spinnaker
- DNS or service mesh route flipping via Istio VirtualServices
- Use `green-weighted` route only after health probe validation

---

## 3. Canary Deployment in RideShareApp
### Process:
- Gradually shift traffic from old → new version (e.g., 1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
- Monitor error rates, latency, and custom KPIs during each step
- Auto rollback on SLO breach

### Scenarios:
- Rider ETA prediction improvements
- Mobile API gateway upgrades
- Payment gateway logic changes

### Canary Rollout Tools:
- Argo Rollouts with metric-based promotion rules
- Prometheus + Linkerd/Istio telemetry
- Custom Web UI for visual cohort targeting

---

## 4. Metrics Monitored
- `http_error_rate`, `p95_latency`, `cpu/mem_spike`
- `booking_conversion_drop`, `cancel_rate_increase`
- `flag_fallback_triggered` (from progressive delivery)

---

## 5. Rollback Policy
- Immediate traffic cut to Green or Canary if:
  - SLO violated >2x threshold
  - Health check failure persists > 60s
- Full rollback audit trail stored in deployment logs
- Alerting via PagerDuty, Slack, Grafana annotations

---

## 6. Governance & CI/CD Integration
- Deployment strategy must be defined in service's Helm values or Argo Rollout spec
- Canary rollout windows not to exceed 48 hours unless pre-approved
- All production deploys require success criteria documented in PR

---

## Summary
Blue/Green and Canary Deployments form the foundation of resilient shipping practices on the RideShareApp Platform. With clear gating, real-time observability, and rollback automation, teams can release with speed and confidence—without sacrificing user trust or platform stability.
