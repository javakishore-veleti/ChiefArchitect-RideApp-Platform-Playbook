# CQRS and Event Sourcing – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the application of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing in the **RideShareApp Platform** to support high scalability, consistency, and auditability of transactional workflows such as trip lifecycle, rider and driver onboarding, driver incentives, and surge pricing.

---

## 1. Concepts Overview
- **CQRS** separates read and write models to optimize performance and decouple transactional behavior from reporting.
- **Event Sourcing** ensures system state is derived from an immutable, append-only log of RideShareApp-specific domain events.

---

## 2. Use Cases in RideShareApp
| Domain Area         | CQRS Role                                                   | Event Sourcing Purpose                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trip Lifecycle      | Commands for book, cancel, update; queries by trip status   | Replayable state via events: `TripCreated`, `TripCompleted`, `TripCancelled` |
| Rider Onboarding    | Command for registration, profile updates                   | Immutable log of KYC flow: `ProfileCreated`, `VerificationPassed`           |
| Driver Incentives   | Register shift completions, compute payouts via projections | Auditable earnings and payout thresholds, `IncentiveGranted` events         |
| Surge Pricing       | Update surge zones and pricing rules                        | Restore zone states and pricing lineage from event stream                   |
| Fraud Investigation | Maintain investigation trails and feedback loops            | Event replay for fraud decision root cause analysis                         |

---

## 3. CQRS Implementation Pattern in RideShareApp
- **Command Side**:
  - Validates domain rules (e.g., driver can’t accept two active trips)
  - Emits events to Kafka topics like `trip.events`, `pricing.events`, `user.profile.events`

- **Query Side**:
  - Updates read models such as:
    - Trip status dashboard (ElasticSearch)
    - Incentive ledger (BigQuery)
    - Rider activity (Redis cache)

- **Async Projection**:
  - Background processors maintain real-time materialized views like `trip_summary_by_region`, `driver_ratings_rollup`

---

## 4. Event Sourcing Standards for RideShareApp
- **Event Format**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "TripCompleted",
  "version": 2,
  "trip_id": "xyz789",
  "rider_id": "r-135",
  "driver_id": "d-598",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T10:20:00Z",
  "fare": 14.75,
  "distance_km": 6.2,
  "region": "San Francisco"
}
```

- **Event Store**:
  - Kafka (for real-time log streaming)
  - BigQuery (for archival, reporting, audit)

- **Schema Evolution**:
  - Events versioned using Avro/Protobuf
  - Schemas stored in centralized schema registry with lifecycle governance

---

## 5. Governance
- All command definitions and events must be declared in the `rideshareapp-domain-contracts` repo
- Proposals must include:
  - Event spec
  - CQRS justification
  - Associated read model shape

- Backstage service catalog entry must document:
  - Kafka topic linkage
  - Downstream projections
  - Replay compatibility status

---

## 6. Tooling Stack
- Kafka + Confluent Schema Registry
- Redis (low-latency reads), BigQuery (batch reads), ElasticSearch (dashboard queries)
- dbt for read model generation
- Airflow DAGs to replay event archives for backfill scenarios

---

## Summary
The CQRS and Event Sourcing model at **RideShareApp Platform** supports real-time agility, observability, and compliance. It enables a scalable foundation for mission-critical use cases such as bookings, surge pricing, and fraud monitoring—while providing a clear audit trail and reproducibility in the platform's complex event-driven workflows.

## Objective
Define the application of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing in the RideShareApp Platform to support high scalability, consistency, and auditability of transactional workflows like trip lifecycle, driver incentives, and surge pricing.

| Domain Area         | CQRS Role                                                   | Event Sourcing Purpose                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trip Lifecycle      | Commands for book, cancel, update; query by trip state      | Reconstruct trip status with `TripCreated`, `TripCancelled`|
| Driver Incentives   | Register actions, compute bonuses via async event projection| Full audit of incentive earnings and threshold triggers    |
| Dynamic Pricing     | Commands to set/update surge policy                         | Rebuild surge zone states via pricing events               |
| Fraud Investigation | Immutable log of actions and detection outcomes             | Event replay for root cause trace                          |

---

## 3. CQRS Implementation Pattern
- **Command Side**:
  - Validates business rules
  - Publishes events to Kafka (`trip.canceled`, `pricing.updated`)
- **Query Side**:
  - Consumes event streams and updates denormalized read stores (e.g. Redis, BigQuery, Elastic)
- **Async Projection**:
  - Materialized views (e.g., `driver_bonus_summary`) built by background processors

---

## 4. Event Sourcing Standards
- **Event Format**:
```json
{
  "event_type": "TripCompleted",
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-06-20T10:20:00Z",
  "actor": "driver:abc123",
  "trip_id": "xyz789",
  "fare": 14.75,
  "distance_km": 6.2
}
```
- **Event Store**:
  - Kafka as primary append-only event log
  - BigQuery archive for audit and historical replay
- **Schema Evolution**:
  - All events are versioned and backward compatible
  - Schema registry used for validation and discovery

---

## 5. Governance
- Commands and events must be defined in the `domain-model/contracts/` repo and reviewed via ADR
- Each CQRS service must be documented in Backstage with:
  - Command API spec
  - Event schema
  - Read model projection diagram
- Replay of events in staging must be tested during onboarding of new services

---

## 6. Tooling
- Kafka, Schema Registry, Protobuf
- dbt + BigQuery for projection models
- Redis and ElasticSearch for fast read models
- Airflow DAGs to backfill projections on event replay

---

## Summary
CQRS and Event Sourcing unlock elasticity and traceability across the RideShareApp Platform. By segregating mutation and query flows, and leveraging immutable event logs, the architecture remains scalable, debuggable, and adaptable to rapid business evolution.
