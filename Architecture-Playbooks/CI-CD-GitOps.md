# CI/CD + GitOps – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Implement a secure, scalable, and autonomous CI/CD and GitOps strategy for the RideShareApp Platform that enables teams to ship confidently, roll back safely, and align infrastructure and application states through Git.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- **Everything as Code**: Application, infra, config, and policy managed via version-controlled Git repositories
- **Declarative Deployments**: All environments are driven by Git-based manifests (Helm/Kustomize)
- **Continuous Feedback**: Visibility into build, test, security, and deployment outcomes via dashboards and PR checks
- **Rollback Ready**: Git reverts provide a one-click rollback mechanism
- **Multi-tenancy Isolation**: Separate CI/CD pipelines per service domain, environment, and region

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Stages
| Stage             | Description                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code Build        | PR triggers unit tests, linting, license scan via GitHub Actions     |
| Containerization  | BuildKit or Dockerfile build, push to GCR/ECR with SBOM              |
| Static Analysis   | SonarQube, Checkov, Trivy run on code and IaC modules                |
| Deployment Plan   | Terraform Plan and Helm Diff visualized as GitHub checks             |
| Approval Gates    | Slack-integration or GitHub review required for Tier 1 promotions    |
| ArgoCD Sync       | Automated post-merge deployment via ArgoCD sync hooks                |

---

## 3. GitOps Implementation
- **Source of Truth**: Git repos for `apps/`, `infra/`, and `platform-config/` as declarative state
- **ArgoCD**: Used to sync state from Git → runtime (GKE, CloudRun, ECS)
- **Argo Rollouts**: Canary or blue/green deployment strategies for critical services like Pricing and Booking
- **Secret Management**: Vault agent sidecar injects secrets at runtime (no Git secrets)
- **Audit Trail**: Every deployment mapped to Git SHA and actor via Backstage deployment tracker

---

## 4. Environment Strategy
| Environment | Features                                                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dev         | Ephemeral preview environments for PR validation (per feature branch) |
| Staging     | Stable UAT with feature flags; load testing against pre-prod datasets |
| Production  | Multi-region GKE clusters; gated release process via ArgoCD          |

---

## 5. Governance and Policies
- **Tier-Based Approvals**: High-risk services require dual approvals and verified GitHub Actions
- **Drift Detection**: Terraform/Helm validated continuously vs. live infra by CI jobs
- **Deployment Freeze Windows**: Automated block on non-critical prod merges during peak ride hours
- **Compliance Hooks**: All CD pipelines log metadata into compliance registry for audit readiness

---

## 6. Toolchain
| Tool         | Role                                                                  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub       | Version control, PR gating, policy checks                            |
| ArgoCD       | Declarative GitOps sync and drift detection                          |
| Terraform    | Infrastructure provisioning and config                               |
| Helm         | Application and service deployment templating                        |
| Trivy/Snyk   | Container and code-level vulnerability scanning                      |
| Vault        | Secret injection at runtime                                          |
| SonarQube    | Static code quality and security                                     |

## Summary
The CI/CD and GitOps strategy at RideShareApp empowers engineers to move fast and ship safely. It blends declarative deployments, environment parity, strong security gates, and traceability into a developer-centric, production-grade delivery model.
