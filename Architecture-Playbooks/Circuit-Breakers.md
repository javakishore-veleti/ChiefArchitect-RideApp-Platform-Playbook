# Circuit Breakers and Bulkheads – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish fault tolerance mechanisms using circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns to isolate and contain failures across RideShareApp Platform services, ensuring that cascading service outages are avoided and platform resiliency is preserved.

---

## 1. Motivation
Given RideShareApp’s highly distributed, latency-sensitive architecture with critical real-time workflows (trip assignment, payments, ETA updates), a single downstream service failure must never compromise overall system stability.

---

## 2. Circuit Breakers
### Definition:
Circuit breakers monitor the success/failure ratio of outbound service calls. When the failure threshold exceeds a configured limit, further requests are short-circuited temporarily.

### Key Scenarios in RideShareApp:
| Upstream Caller        | Downstream Service     | Reason for Circuit Breaker               |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Rider App              | ETA Service            | Avoid UI blocking due to slow estimates  |
| Booking Gateway        | Payment Processor      | Prevent user double charges             |
| Incentive Service      | Ledger Service         | Prevent retries from flooding queue     |
| Admin Portal           | Trip Audit Log         | Graceful degradation on non-critical ops |

### Config Parameters:
- Error Threshold Percentage: 50%
- Sliding Window Duration: 30 seconds
- Timeout for Retry: 60 seconds
- Fallback: Cached response / UI placeholder

## 3. Bulkheads
### Definition:
Bulkheads allocate isolated resource pools (e.g., threads, queues, connection pools) to different components, ensuring that an overloaded or misbehaving service doesn’t exhaust shared resources.

### Examples in RideShareApp:
| Service                 | Isolation Pool Type      | Notes                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Booking Service         | Thread Pool by Region    | Regional surge in bookings doesn’t starve other regions  |
| Notification Dispatcher | Queue Partition per Type | SMS, Email, Push handled with separate backpressure      |
| Partner API Gateway     | Connection Pool per Client| Prevent partner A from affecting partner B’s traffic     |
| Payment Gateway         | Subprocess Isolation      | Third-party slowness doesn’t lock main payment flow      |

## 4. Implementation Frameworks
- **Java**: Resilience4j, Hystrix (legacy)
- **Node.js**: Opossum
- **Go**: Sony’s go-breaker, bulkhead-pool
- **Istio**: Envoy circuit breakers and outlier detection at mesh level

---

## 5. Observability & Alerts
- Expose metrics: `circuit_breaker_open`, `bulkhead_rejections`, latency histograms
- Integrate with Grafana dashboards per service tier
- Auto-alert on repeated tripping events or fallback degradation

---

## 6. Governance & Rollout
- Every critical service path must define circuit breaker and bulkhead rules in Helm charts or Sidecar config
- Reviews in architecture council meetings
- Include failure simulation during chaos testing and DR drills

---

## Summary
Circuit breakers and bulkheads are core to the RideShareApp Platform’s fault isolation strategy. They allow us to fail fast, recover gracefully, and shield unrelated workloads during partial outages—preserving platform availability and trust at scale.
