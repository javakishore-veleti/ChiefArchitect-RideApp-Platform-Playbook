# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) practices across the RideShareApp Platform to drive strategic alignment between engineering and business domains, enable modular system evolution, and foster team autonomy and bounded context ownership.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between engineers and domain experts (e.g., "trip", "rider intent", "match")
- **Bounded Contexts**: Clearly scoped boundaries around business capabilities and microservices
- **Context Mapping**: Identify upstream/downstream dependencies and translation layers
- **Aggregate Roots**: Maintain business consistency boundaries with clean aggregate models
- **Domain Events**: Represent explicit business state transitions and their impact

## 2. Identified Bounded Contexts
| Context             | Description                                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trip Management     | Booking, routing, state transitions, cancellation, completion           |
| Matching Engine     | Driver discovery, scoring, trip allocation                              |
| Pricing & Surge     | Real-time pricing, fare estimations, surge tier computation             |
| Driver Experience   | Shift scheduling, onboarding, rating, compliance checks                 |
| Rider Profile       | Identity, preferences, saved locations, loyalty rewards                 |
| Payment Processing  | Invoicing, coupons, retries, refunds                                     |
| Notifications       | Push/email/sms communication, rider alerts, driver prompts              |
| Fraud & Safety      | Risk scoring, anomaly detection, background verification                |

---

## 3. Modeling Guidelines
- Each context should own its:
  - Data model (including access policy and lifecycle)
  - API contract (REST/gRPC/OpenAPI)
  - Event schema (`trip.accepted`, `pricing.updated`)
- Avoid sharing database tables across contexts
- Expose state changes via **events**, not by polling or direct read access
- Apply **anti-corruption layers (ACL)** when integrating legacy or partner systems

---

## 4. Implementation Playbook
- Use DDD modeling sessions during feature ideation and event storming
- Annotate service repos with context metadata (e.g., `context: trip-management`)
- Implement `context-map.yaml` files and publish via Backstage
- Context owners must publish and evolve domain vocabulary via markdown glossaries

## 5. Squad Alignment & Autonomy
| Squad              | Bounded Context(s) Owned                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| TripCore           | Trip Management                                            |
| SurgeOps           | Pricing & Surge                                            |
| DriverExp          | Driver Experience                                          |
| RiderEngage        | Notifications, Rider Profile                               |
| PaymentInfra       | Payment Processing                                         |
| Trust & Safety     | Fraud & Safety                                             |

---

## 6. Governance & Change Control
- Context boundary changes must undergo architecture review and ADR publication
- Breaking API/event changes require RFC and notify upstream/downstream stakeholders
- All new services must define their bounded context in onboarding checklist

---

## Summary
Domain-Driven Design structures RideShareApp around business-aligned, autonomous service boundaries. It empowers product engineering teams to evolve rapidly while maintaining clarity of ownership, consistent language, and scalable architecture contracts.
