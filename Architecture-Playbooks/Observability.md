# Observability and Tracing – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Implement robust observability and distributed tracing strategies across the RideShareApp Platform to achieve real-time visibility, accelerate root cause analysis, and maintain high availability across complex, multi-service workloads like trip booking, driver routing, and payments.

---

## 1. Pillars of Observability
RideShareApp observability spans across the three core pillars:

### Metrics
- **Service-level indicators (SLIs)**:
  - `request_rate`, `error_rate`, `latency_p95`, `success_ratio`
- **Platform KPIs**:
  - Trip success %, ETA SLA, payment reconciliation window

### Logs
- Structured JSON logs with trace ID, user ID, region, feature flag state
- All logs are centralized in **ELK** and **GCP Cloud Logging**

### Traces
- OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing
- Collected via sidecars (Envoy / OpenTelemetry Collector)
- Exported to **Grafana Tempo** and visualized via **Grafana** dashboards

---

## 2. Tracing Architecture
- Every inbound request to an API Gateway is tagged with a **trace ID** and **span context**
- Propagation across:
  - API Gateway → Service Mesh → Backend Services → Kafka Streams → DB Calls
- Context headers:
  - `x-request-id`, `x-trace-id`, `x-user-id`

### Tracing Scenarios:
| Workflow               | Key Traceable Steps                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Trip Booking           | API Gateway → Trip Service → Driver Matching → Payment |
| Surge Pricing Update   | Admin UI → Pricing API → Redis + Kafka Sync           |
| ETA Pipeline           | Rider App → ETA API → ML Model → Feature Store         |

---

## 3. Tooling Stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry + Tempo
- **Logs**: Fluent Bit → Cloud Logging / Elasticsearch
- **Alerting**: Grafana Alerts + PagerDuty

---

## 4. Dashboards
Each team maintains:
- **Service Health Dashboards**:
  - CPU/memory, latency, RPS, 5xx errors, DB errors
- **Workflow Dashboards**:
  - Booking Conversion Funnel, Driver Engagement, Payments Latency
- **Trace Explorer Dashboards**:
  - Slow spans, span errors, propagation depth

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Always log user ID, trip ID, trace ID
- Add span attributes for region, app version, environment
- Ensure trace sampling is adaptive: 100% for errors, 10% for healthy flows
- Use service-level SLOs and link them to traces in Grafana

---

## 6. Governance
- All services must emit metrics, logs, and traces before moving to prod
- Trace-to-incident mapping required for RCA completeness
- Dashboards must be reviewed quarterly in observability audits
- Observability configuration codified in Helm charts and tracked via GitOps

---

## Summary
Observability and tracing are foundational to RideShareApp’s reliability strategy. With full-stack visibility—from mobile tap to backend DB—we empower SREs, engineers, and leadership to detect issues early, understand service behavior, and deliver a high-quality user experience at global scale.
