# Polyglot Persistence Strategy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a platform-wide strategy for selecting, operating, and governing a diverse set of purpose-fit data stores (SQL, NoSQL, time-series, document, graph) to meet the varied consistency, latency, and scalability demands across RideShareApp’s business domains.

---

## 1. Why Polyglot Persistence in RideShareApp?
- Trip bookings require strict consistency and ACID guarantees → relational DBs (PostgreSQL)
- Driver location updates are high-volume, append-only events → time-series stores (InfluxDB)
- Rider and driver profiles contain nested, sparse metadata → document DBs (MongoDB)
- Surge pricing zones and traffic maps benefit from spatial queries → geospatial indexing (PostGIS)
- Social graph, referrals, and trust indicators → graph DBs (Neo4j)

## 2. Domain-Aligned Data Store Map
| Domain Area            | Data Type               | Recommended Store       |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Trip & Payment Records | Relational + Audit Trail| PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB |
| Driver Location Stream | Time-Series             | InfluxDB                 |
| Promotion Engine       | Rule Documents          | MongoDB                  |
| Surge Pricing          | Geo-Spatial             | PostGIS (PostgreSQL)     |
| Fraud Signals          | Graph + Events          | Neo4j + Kafka            |
| Rider Preferences      | Key-Value               | Redis                    |
| Feature Store (ML)     | Columnar + Immutable    | BigQuery + DeltaLake     |

## 3. Design Guidelines
- **Store Purposefully**: Select the engine based on read/write pattern, not convenience
- **Avoid Multi-Store per Microservice**: Each service should own one primary data backend
- **Data Contracts**: Use Protobuf/Avro schemas for events and database serialization
- **Backfill Considerations**: Choose data stores with replayable logs for analytics and ML readiness
- **Latency SLAs**:
  - P95 for reads: < 100ms for Rider, < 200ms for Partner dashboards
  - Writes: < 50ms for transactional flows, < 10s for analytical stores

---

## 4. Operational Model
- **Managed Services**:
  - PostgreSQL (CloudSQL), BigQuery (GCP), Mongo Atlas
- **Sharding**:
  - Trip tables sharded by `region_id`
  - Incentive payouts sharded by `driver_id`
- **Monitoring**:
  - Query latency dashboards per store
  - Dead-letter queues for failed writes (Kafka→DB sinks)
- **Data Archival**:
  - Regulatory data (e.g., PII, payments) moved to cold storage after 180 days

---

## 5. Tooling & Governance
- `data-store-catalog.yaml` defining owner, cost, RTO/RPO, access pattern
- All data stores tagged in Backstage for discoverability
- CI validation of DB schema migrations with linting and rollback plan
- Shared playbooks for:
  - Read vs write-optimized table design
  - Time-windowed partitioning
  - Geo-sharding patterns

---

## Summary
The RideShareApp Platform embraces polyglot persistence to ensure each data workload is optimized for its domain’s consistency, throughput, and retrieval needs. With governance, tooling, and patterns in place, this strategy empowers teams to scale responsibly while maintaining performance and compliance.
