# Feature Flags and Progressive Delivery â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a controlled and reversible deployment strategy for the RideShareApp Platform using feature flags and progressive delivery techniques. This ensures safe rollouts, rapid experimentation, and high system stability for both internal tools and rider-facing applications.

---

## 1. Why Feature Flags Matter
- **Safe Rollouts**: Deploy features gradually to subsets of users
- **Operational Flexibility**: Disable faulty features without rollback
- **A/B Testing**: Drive user experimentation through flag-driven behavior
- **Multi-Tenant Customization**: Toggle features based on partner agreements or geographies

## 2. Feature Flag Use Cases in RideShareApp
| Use Case                         | Type           | Notes                                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| New Rider Referral Flow          | Boolean Flag   | Enabled for 5% of users in San Francisco               |
| Tiered Pricing Engine            | Multi-Variant  | A/B test flat vs dynamic vs surge pricing              |
| Enterprise Partner Dashboards    | Role-Based     | Enable premium analytics only for select partners      |
| ETA Algorithm Improvements       | Gradual Rollout| Percentage-based rollout over 7 days                   |
| Driver Incentive UI Redesign     | Sticky Variant | Flag tied to session ID for stable UX                  |

## 3. Tooling
- **Flag Providers**:
  - LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or internal flag service
- **SDK Support**:
  - SDKs for Node.js (API Gateway), Kotlin (Android), Swift (iOS), Go (backend)
- **Flag Evaluation**:
  - Local caching with periodic remote refresh
  - Fail-open or fail-closed defaults defined per flag

---

## 4. Progressive Delivery Techniques
- **Canary Deployments**: Ship to small % of production pods first
- **User Cohort Targeting**: Roll out by region, app version, OS, fleet ID
- **Error Budget Awareness**: Halt rollout if error/latency exceeds threshold
- **Kill Switches**: Rapidly disable via admin console without CI/CD redeploy

---

## 5. Governance & Observability
- All flags must be:
  - Registered with owner, type, TTL in `feature-flags-registry.yaml`
  - Reviewed quarterly for sunset eligibility
- Metrics:
  - `flag_eval_count`, `flag_enabled_rate`, `flag-induced_error_rate`
- Flags tied to critical workflows (trip booking, payments) require chaos testing fallback

---

## 6. Developer Best Practices
- Wrap logic using SDK-provided helpers
- Keep flag impact localized and invertible
- Never assume a flag is always ON or OFF in code reviews
- Include flag state in logs for observability

---

## Summary
Feature Flags and Progressive Delivery empower RideShareApp to iterate faster, reduce incident risk, and align deployment pace with user segmentation. Used responsibly, this model enhances developer agility while preserving platform reliability and user trust.
