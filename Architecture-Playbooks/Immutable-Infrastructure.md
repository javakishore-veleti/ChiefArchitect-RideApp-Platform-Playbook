# Immutable Infrastructure – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish an immutable infrastructure strategy for the RideShareApp Platform to improve environment consistency, reduce configuration drift, simplify rollback, and enable repeatable, auditable platform deployments.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **No Mutations Post-Deployment**: Infrastructure artifacts (VMs, containers, Helm charts) are never modified after provisioning
- **Version Everything**: Images, manifests, and Terraform modules are version-pinned and traceable
- **Stateless First**: State is externalized (e.g., GCS, managed DBs, config maps) for clean, replicable environments
- **Rollback by Replace**: Recovery flows prefer redeploying previous versions over patching live assets

---

## 2. Immutable Infrastructure Patterns in RideShareApp
| Area                  | Implementation                                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute               | GKE-managed nodes with pre-baked container images for Trip, Match, ETA       |
| Infra as Code         | Terraform modules for GCP IAM, Pub/Sub, VPC, KMS; no UI-based edits          |
| CI/CD Pipelines       | GitHub → ArgoCD → versioned Helm releases, image tags, config snapshots     |
| Mobile Builds         | Immutable Rider/Driver SDKs with notarized builds, no hotfix patching        |
| ML Models             | Versioned `model-artifacts.tar.gz` deployed via pipelines (no inline edits) |

---

## 3. Tooling and Automation
- **Packer**: Golden base image creation for GKE node pools and CI runners
- **HashiCorp Terraform**: Declarative resource provisioning with state stored in GCS
- **ArgoCD**: Declarative sync of manifests, rollback, and health enforcement
- **BuildKit**: Reproducible Docker builds with remote cache and SBOM annotations
- **Vault**: Secrets injected at runtime (never baked into images)

---

## 4. Policy Enforcement
- CI checks fail if Terraform drift is detected between plan and live
- All Helm charts must be versioned in `infra/helm/` with rollback support
- ArgoCD sync gates block UI/manual edits to production workloads
- Model registry must record hash and source config for all promoted models
- Mobile releases require signed immutable bundles (CI/CD signing job required)

---

## 5. Benefits
- Predictable recovery from failure via clean redeployments
- No drift between staging and production environments
- Regulatory audit readiness with traceable infrastructure lineage
- Reduced incident surface by eliminating runtime mutations

---

## Summary
Immutable infrastructure is a foundational practice in RideShareApp’s platform engineering strategy. By enforcing declarative deployments, eliminating live mutations, and versioning all assets, we ensure stability, compliance, and rapid recoverability at global scale.
