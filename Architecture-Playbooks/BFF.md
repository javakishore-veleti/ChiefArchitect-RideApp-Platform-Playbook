# Backend for Frontend (BFF) – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the architectural principles, use cases, and operational guidelines for implementing Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) patterns within the RideShareApp Platform. BFFs are used to optimize API experiences for Rider, Driver, and Partner-facing applications.

---

## 1. Purpose
- **UI Optimization**: Tailor API responses to match mobile/web app structure and latency expectations
- **Domain Aggregation**: Combine data from multiple microservices (e.g., Trip, Pricing, Promotions) into a single optimized payload
- **Security Mediation**: Translate auth tokens, enforce scoping, and minimize exposure to internal API structures
- **Version Control**: Manage per-app API contracts that evolve independently

## 2. Key BFF Instances in RideShareApp
| BFF Service        | Clients           | Key Responsibilities                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| RiderBFF           | iOS, Android      | Fetch trip state, available promotions, location updates   |
| DriverBFF          | Android           | Provide shift status, earnings summary, trip alerts        |
| PartnerPortalBFF   | Web               | Aggregate fleet stats, access control, billing summaries   |
| AdminOpsBFF        | Internal UI       | Driver compliance status, KYC approvals, admin logs        |

---

## 3. Design Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility**: Each BFF serves only one frontend and owns its contract
- **Minimal Business Logic**: Keep business logic in backend services; BFFs only compose and reshape data
- **Error Normalization**: Convert downstream service errors into consistent frontend-friendly formats
- **Caching**: Use edge or memory caching for static resources (e.g., promotions, terms of service)
- **Feature Flags**: Enable UI-driven experiments using BFF-driven flag injection (via LaunchDarkly, etc.)

---

## 4. Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript (preferred), Go for high-throughput services
- **API Composition**: GraphQL or REST proxy depending on client needs
- **Auth**: JWT validation, token introspection, refresh token exchange with OAuth2 provider
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry, structured logs

---

## 5. Deployment and Governance
- BFFs are deployed as separate services in dedicated namespaces (e.g., `bff-rider`, `bff-partner`)
- GitHub CI/CD enforces:
  - API contract diff checks
  - Code linting, coverage, and static analysis
  - Canary rollouts with auto-revert on latency spike
- OpenAPI/GraphQL schema must be published in Backstage and version-tagged
- Any new BFF requires Architecture Council review

---

## 6. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Embedding domain logic in BFFs
- Reusing a BFF for multiple frontends (violates SRP)
- Circumventing auth enforcement
- Bypassing circuit breakers or cache for performance testing

---

## Summary
BFFs in the RideShareApp Platform are not just request proxies—they're context-specific optimization layers. They ensure that mobile and web clients get performant, secure, and decoupled access to backend capabilities while preserving contract agility and platform integrity.
