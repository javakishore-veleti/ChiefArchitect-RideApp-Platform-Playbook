# Security and Zero Trust – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a Zero Trust security architecture for the RideShareApp Platform that safeguards APIs, workloads, data, and developer workflows through identity enforcement, continuous validation, least privilege, and microsegmentation.

## 1. Zero Trust Principles in Context
| Principle              | RideShareApp Implementation                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Verify Explicitly      | Mutual TLS across all microservices, device identity checks for Rider/Driver apps           |
| Least Privilege Access | IAM roles with scoped permissions, time-limited access for SREs and Data Scientists        |
| Assume Breach          | All internal traffic authenticated and logged; no implicit trust within the VPC            |
| Continuous Validation  | Session re-auth for long-lived user workflows (e.g., KYC, payout, partner onboarding)      |
| Segmentation           | Namespace-based policies across Booking, Pricing, Driver Identity services                 |

---

## 2. Security Enforcement Layers
- **API Gateway**: Enforces OAuth2, rate limiting, IP allowlists for external APIs
- **Service Mesh (Istio)**: Mutual TLS, peer auth policies, encrypted telemetry routing
- **Vault Integration**: Service-to-service secrets injected at runtime; no static secret sprawl
- **IAM & RBAC**: Fine-grained access tied to engineering squads and data zones (Rider, Driver, Payments)
- **Runtime Enforcement**: Falco and eBPF-based intrusion detection for container activity

---

## 3. Developer Security Workflow
- Static analysis via SonarQube and Snyk on every PR
- Required GitHub code signing and branch protection on Tier 1 services
- All infrastructure must go through OPA policy checks (Terraform + Helm)
- Security Champions per team ensure weekly reviews of access policies and secrets hygiene

## 4. Access & Secrets Governance
| Asset Type          | Governance Pattern                                                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GCP IAM             | `least privilege`, enforced via Terraform modules, reviewed monthly                      |
| DB Credentials      | Rotated every 14 days, injected via Vault + service mesh, no access via app env vars     |
| Admin Dashboards    | SSO only, enforced re-authentication for critical actions (refunds, driver deactivation) |
| ML Feature Store    | Role-scoped access; all PII queries logged and rate-limited                              |

---

## 5. Audit and Monitoring
- Logs shipped to centralized store (BigQuery) with field-level redaction (e.g., PII masking)
- Alerting on privilege escalations, IAM anomalies, suspicious login patterns
- Federated dashboards for Privacy, Compliance, and Security teams

---

## 6. Roadmap & Maturity
- ✅ Phase 1: mTLS, Vault rollout, basic IAM segmentation
- ✅ Phase 2: eBPF detection, secrets rotation automation, schema firewalling
- ⏳ Phase 3: Zero Trust for ML inference, per-model RBAC, federated secrets gateway

---

## Summary
Zero Trust in RideShareApp is not a product—it’s a foundational mindset. Every identity is verified, every connection encrypted, and every access tracked. This ensures trust is earned continuously—powering safe trips, scalable APIs, and platform-wide resilience.
