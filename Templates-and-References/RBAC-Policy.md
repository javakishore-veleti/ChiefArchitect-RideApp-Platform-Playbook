# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policy â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a consistent and auditable RBAC policy to govern platform-wide access to APIs, data assets, infrastructure, dashboards, and operational tools across the RideShareApp Platform.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- **Least Privilege**: Users and services are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their roles.
- **Segregation of Duties**: Sensitive capabilities (e.g., fare override, driver ban) require dual role approvals.
- **Auditability**: All access assignments and escalations are logged and reviewable.
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevated privileges are time-bound and approval-gated.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Description                                      | Examples of Permissions |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| RiderOps Analyst    | Monitors ride KPIs and rider feedback            | View dashboards, query reports |
| DriverOps Manager   | Oversees driver onboarding and compliance        | Access driver roster, approve accounts |
| Pricing Analyst     | Manages surge zones and fare tuning              | Edit pricing policies, run simulations |
| Platform Engineer   | Maintains service infra and CI/CD pipelines      | Modify Helm charts, deploy services |
| Data Scientist      | Builds models and performs ad-hoc analysis       | Access feature store, run notebooks |
| SRE                 | Handles availability and production support      | Restart pods, access logs, manage alerts |
| Security Admin      | Audits IAM roles and configures access policies  | Grant/revoke access, rotate keys |

---

## 3. Resources Covered
- **APIs**: Internal REST/gRPC APIs grouped by domain (rider, pricing, ETA, fraud, etc.)
- **Data Assets**: Data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake), Feature Stores, S3 buckets
- **ML Resources**: Training pipelines, model registries, inference endpoints
- **Infra Components**: ArgoCD, Kubernetes, Terraform state, GitHub repositories
- **Dashboards**: Grafana, Superset, Datadog, Sentry
- **Secrets**: API keys, DB credentials, OAuth tokens (managed via Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)

---

## 4. Access Workflow
- All role assignments requested via internal Access Portal
- Every request must:
  - Specify business justification and access duration
  - Be reviewed by designated approvers per resource category
  - Be auto-logged to the RBAC audit trail (stored in central S3 bucket)
- Weekly scan for orphaned roles or stale access

---

## 5. Policy Enforcement Tools
- OPA/Gatekeeper policies on Kubernetes for namespace access
- IAM policy sync from GitHub YAML files (GitOps RBAC)
- Slackbot or CLI-based access request approval flows
- Sentry + Datadog alerting for privilege misuse

---

## 6. Governance and Audits
- Quarterly access reviews by Security and Domain Leads
- Biannual penetration tests against role boundaries
- All elevated access requests retained for 1 year minimum
- Compliance with SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, and regional mobility laws

---

## Summary
This RBAC policy standardizes how access is granted, monitored, and revoked across the RideShareApp Platform. It enables secure collaboration across product, engineering, data, and operations while maintaining regulatory alignment and minimizing insider risk.
