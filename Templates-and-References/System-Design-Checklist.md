# System Design Checklist â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Ensure that new systems or features in the RideShareApp Platform are designed with robustness, scalability, observability, and compliance in mind. This checklist helps teams assess tradeoffs and identify gaps early in the lifecycle.

---

## 1. Functional and Domain Design
- [ ] What is the user/business problem this system solves?
- [ ] Is this feature aligned with a specific domain (Rider, Driver, Ops, ML, Partner)?
- [ ] Are key use cases clearly mapped out and prioritized?
- [ ] Have edge cases and failure scenarios been modeled?

## 2. API and Interface Design
- [ ] Are API contracts clearly defined (OpenAPI/Protobuf/GraphQL)?
- [ ] Are interfaces consistent with platform-wide naming/versioning conventions?
- [ ] Are there backwards compatibility guarantees or version negotiation?
- [ ] Is service discovery and API documentation covered?

## 3. Data Design
- [ ] What structured/unstructured data will this service consume/produce?
- [ ] Are data schemas versioned and owned?
- [ ] Does it reuse the Feature Store for derived signals or models?
- [ ] What are the read/write patterns and expected volumes?
- [ ] Is sensitive or regulated data involved (PII, PCI)?

## 4. Architecture & Scalability
- [ ] What are the SLAs (latency, availability, throughput)?
- [ ] Have resilience patterns been applied (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers)?
- [ ] Is horizontal scaling considered?
- [ ] Does the service participate in event-driven workflows (e.g., via Kafka)?
- [ ] Are multi-tenant or zone-aware designs applicable?

## 5. Storage & Caching
- [ ] Is there a plan for caching (Redis, CDN, local memory)?
- [ ] What is the storage layer (Postgres, BigQuery, DynamoDB, S3)?
- [ ] Are there archival or TTL requirements?
- [ ] Are indexes and partitioning designed for scale?

## 6. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Are data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- [ ] Are APIs authenticated (JWT, OAuth, mTLS)?
- [ ] Is role-based access control (RBAC) defined?
- [ ] Has it passed security review for PII or financial data?
- [ ] Are GDPR/CCPA/PCI constraints documented?

## 7. Observability & Debuggability
- [ ] Are logs structured and contextual (request ID, tenant ID)?
- [ ] Are metrics exported for latency, error rate, QPS, etc.?
- [ ] Are traces available via OpenTelemetry or similar?
- [ ] Are dashboards and alerts created pre-launch?
- [ ] Is SLO/SLA monitoring configured?

## 8. Testing and Resilience
- [ ] Unit and integration test coverage > 80%?
- [ ] Are load, chaos, and fault-injection tests planned?
- [ ] Are rollback and kill switches implemented?
- [ ] Are canary or shadow deployments used before full rollout?

## 9. Deployment & Operational Readiness
- [ ] Helm/Kustomize manifests or Terraform defined?
- [ ] Is it supported by CI/CD pipelines with auto rollback?
- [ ] Is the service tagged with ownership metadata?
- [ ] Does it follow the tagging/labeling convention for cost visibility?

## 10. AI/ML Integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Are models served in real-time or batch?
- [ ] Are model endpoints versioned and monitored?
- [ ] Does it use online features or embeddings?
- [ ] Are model fairness/explainability hooks enabled?

## Summary
Use this checklist to align with RideShareApp platform standards and catch architectural, security, or scaling concerns before implementation. Keep it version-controlled and reviewed during design doc reviews or RFC cycles.
