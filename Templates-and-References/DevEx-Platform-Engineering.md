# DevEx & Platform Engineering – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Create an internal developer platform (IDP) that improves developer experience (DevEx), speeds up delivery, and provides consistent standards across services, infrastructure, observability, and ML lifecycle management.

---

## Strategic Goals
- Minimize cognitive load and boilerplate for product teams
- Standardize service scaffolding, deployment, and observability across orgs
- Provide golden paths for typical workflows (REST service, Kafka consumer, ML job)
- Improve security, quality, and velocity through paved paths

---

## Pillars of Developer Experience

### 1. **Self-Service Tooling**
- Scaffold new services with `rideapp-cli` or Backstage plugin
- Self-service Terraform modules for infra (S3, Kafka, RDS, etc.)
- Jenkins/GitHub Actions templates for CI/CD setup
- Secure secrets onboarding via Vault/SSM integrators

### 2. **Golden Paths & Templates**
- REST + gRPC service templates
- Event-driven microservice starter kits
- ML training + inference pipelines with built-in monitoring
- Reusable observability sidecars and logging wrappers

### 3. **Developer Portal**
- Centralized documentation: APIs, playbooks, runbooks
- UI to launch environments, query service ownership, inspect logs
- Integrated Swagger/OpenAPI + Postman explorer
- Team-level dashboards: deployment frequency, failed builds, coverage

### 4. **Dev Environment Management**
- One-click setup via DevContainers or Codespaces support
- Gitpod-style ephemeral dev environments with cloud sync
- Local mocks and simulators for Rider/Driver APIs

### 5. **Observability & Debuggability by Default**
- Default metrics/logs/traces for all scaffolded services
- Service mesh and tracing pre-wired into templates
- On-call alerting tied to service ownership labels
- Preconfigured SLO dashboards in Datadog/Grafana

### 6. **Governance & Quality Gates**
- Mandatory code linting and static analysis in CI
- PR size, test coverage, and dependency checks
- GitHub checks for ADR linking and documentation inclusion
- Auto-reminders for review SLAs and stale PRs

---

## Developer Experience Metrics
- Time-to-first PR merged
- Time-to-deploy a new service to staging
- % of repos using golden path templates
- Mean time to rollback and time to alert resolution
- Dev satisfaction score (internal survey)

---

## Summary
DevEx and Platform Engineering for RideShareApp is not just about tools—it’s about removing friction, encouraging consistency, and aligning developers to shared best practices. With a combination of paved paths, developer portals, and observability by default, we empower teams to ship resilient, observable, and secure systems faster.
