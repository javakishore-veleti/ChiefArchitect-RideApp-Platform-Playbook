# CI/CD Pipeline – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) strategy, tooling, and pipeline structure used by the RideShareApp Platform to ensure fast, safe, and repeatable releases across microservices, ML models, and shared infrastructure.

---

## 1. Pipeline Overview
- **CI Stages**:
  - Code checkout and build validation
  - Unit and integration test execution
  - Linting, schema validation, static analysis
  - Artifact packaging (Docker, JAR, Python wheel, etc.)

- **CD Stages**:
  - Deploy to dev and staging environments with progressive rollout
  - Smoke tests and synthetic transaction testing
  - Canary deployment to production with metrics validation
  - Full production rollout based on health checks and release guardrails

---

## 2. Tooling & Infrastructure
- **CI**: GitHub Actions, reusable workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yaml`)
- **Artifact Registry**: GitHub Packages, Amazon ECR, PyPI (internal)
- **Deploy Engine**: ArgoCD (Kubernetes), Terraform (Infra as Code), Helm
- **Notifications**: Slack, Email, PagerDuty integrations on failure or approval gates

---

## 3. Deployment Models
- **Microservices**:
  - Tagged builds trigger ArgoCD sync with version bump in Helm values
  - Deployments validated via pre/post-hooks (smoke checks)
  - Blue/Green or Canary rollout strategies by default

- **ML Pipelines**:
  - `train → validate → stage-model → approve → deploy`
  - Model metadata tracked via MLFlow or SageMaker Model Registry
  - Serving platform uses Triton or custom REST endpoints

- **Schema Contracts**:
  - Changes to Avro/Protobuf checked via `rideapp-schema-validator`
  - Registry updates gated by compatibility tests and governance review

---

## 4. Approval and Safeguards
- PR approvals required from domain leads + security reviewer for production deploys
- Sensitive services (e.g., Pricing, Matching) require dual sign-off
- GitHub protected branches with mandatory status checks
- Time-based canaries with rollback if error budget violated

---

## 5. Environment Structure
| Environment | Purpose                | Data Fidelity     | Restrictions           |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Dev         | Developer iteration    | Synthetic          | Open access           |
| Staging     | Pre-prod validation    | Anonymized samples | RBAC restricted       |
| Prod-C1     | Production Cluster 1   | Live               | Change management req |
| Prod-C2     | Production Cluster 2   | Live               | Canary staging        |

---

## 6. Metrics & Governance
- Deployment frequency and lead time tracked in DORA dashboards
- Rollback rate and failure-to-recover metrics captured via Datadog + Grafana
- GitHub labels (e.g., `infra-change`, `ml-rollout`, `canary-risk`) auto-trigger approval flows
- Audit logs of deployment history and actor identity stored in S3 via ArgoCD hooks

---

## Summary
The RideShareApp Platform CI/CD pipeline balances velocity and safety through a codified, GitOps-first approach. With reusable workflows, automated validation gates, and observability baked in, it enables scalable deployments across real-time systems and intelligent ML workflows.
