# Developer Onboarding – Ride App Platform

## Objective
Provide a role-specific onboarding guide tailored to developers joining the Ride App Platform initiative. This process ensures rapid ramp-up across multi-tenant architecture, microservices, real-time systems, and AI-powered backend capabilities that underpin the ride-hailing ecosystem.

---

## Week 0: Pre-Onboarding (IT & Access Provisioning)
- Email, Slack, VPN, GitHub Enterprise, and JIRA account setup
- Access to platform GitHub repos: `ChiefArchitect-RideApp-Platform-Playbook`, `rideapp-core-services`, `pricing-engine`, `eta-forecasting`, `infra-modules`, etc.
- Add to onboarding Slack channel: `#rideapp-dev-onboarding`
- Provision access to:
  - Datadog (monitoring dashboards)
  - Prometheus/Grafana (infra metrics)
  - BigQuery/DynamoDB (for dev-tier queries)
  - Model registry and feature store (for ML-integrated teams)
- Assign onboarding buddy (from same tech domain) and onboarding manager

---

## Week 1: Orientation & Local Development Setup
- Attend Ride App Product & Platform kickoff with Chief Architect or Staff Engineer
- Review README files across major repos:
  - `rideapp-api-gateway`, `dispatch-orchestration`, `driver-matching`, `fraud-detection` modules
- Clone and bootstrap one microservice locally using provided Docker Compose stack
- Validate internal service registry & service discovery setup
- Run unit/integration tests with mocks via `rideapp-shared-libs`
- Familiarize with service contract definitions (OpenAPI/Swagger)

---

## Week 2: Architecture and Domain Onboarding
- Read selected Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) related to:
  - Event-driven architecture (Kafka)
  - Data contracts (Protobuf, Avro)
  - Scalability patterns (Service Mesh, circuit breakers, retries)
- Understand domain boundaries: Rider vs Driver vs Ops vs ML APIs
- Attend walkthrough of platform capabilities:
  - Real-time ETA prediction
  - Surge Pricing policy engine
  - ML model integration and rollout pipeline
- Join weekly `#platform-tech-forum` and ask onboarding-specific questions

---

## Week 3: Guided Contributions
- Assigned starter Jira issue or GitHub issue:
  - Extend a REST endpoint
  - Add test coverage for a schema migration
  - Refactor an event producer or consumer with observability tags
- Shadow a PR from senior engineer for review and deployment
- Participate in sprint ceremonies (standup, planning, retro)
- Attend a postmortem to learn from past production incidents

---

## Week 4: Performance Review & Platform Integration
- Demo completed issue or improvement in internal tech showcase
- Review onboarding checklist with buddy and manager
- Set next 90-day goals: code, architecture, DevOps, ML integrations
- Opt-in to join a special initiative (e.g., OpenAPI governance, infra as code)
- Gather feedback on tooling gaps, documentation needs, and friction points

---

## Core Resources
- Ride App Platform Handbook (GitHub `ChiefArchitect-RideApp-Platform-Playbook`)
- Swagger/OpenAPI UI links for major services
- ML model serving registry (versioned endpoints)
- Shared observability dashboards (pre-configured in Datadog)
- Security and compliance training materials (GDPR, PCI-DSS)

---

## Metrics of Success
- Time to first successful PR in `rideapp-core-services`
- Local environment setup < 2 days
- Documentation contributions (README, test plan, ADR suggestions)
- Completion of security & compliance onboarding checklist
- Retention and satisfaction score after 30/60/90 days

---

## Summary
The Ride App Platform onboarding process ensures engineers become productive quickly by immersing them in the architecture, tooling, workflows, and culture that power a multi-tenant, ML-augmented, real-time platform. This tailored journey accelerates alignment and builds a strong foundation for high-impact contributions.
