# Observability Dashboards – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define standard observability dashboards for the RideShareApp Platform to ensure service health, operational insight, and proactive issue detection across real-time ride-hailing, pricing, ETA prediction, and fleet intelligence systems.

---

## 1. Dashboard Categories

### a. Platform Core Services
- **API Gateway Dashboard**
  - Request volume by endpoint (e.g., `/book-ride`, `/cancel`, `/fare-estimate`) and tenant (fleet operators, partner integrations)
  - Latency heatmaps (P50, P95, P99) during surge windows
  - Rate limit rejections and auth failures tied to region or client app version

- **Service Mesh Health**
  - Inter-service calls between `rider-service`, `matching-engine`, `pricing-service`
  - Retry counts and circuit breaker events during peak demand (e.g., festival hours)
  - TLS handshake failures for external vendor calls (e.g., mapping provider, payment gateway)

- **Kubernetes & Infra**
  - Pod CPU/memory usage for high-traffic services (e.g., `booking-coordinator`, `driver-tracking`)
  - Cluster autoscaler effectiveness during flash demand spikes
  - Node and pod saturation across availability zones

### b. Domain-Specific Dashboards
- **Ride Matching Engine**
  - Match success rate by city/zone and time of day
  - Average rider wait time segmented by rider segment (regular vs. corporate)
  - Reroute ratio for partially matched or rebooked trips

- **Pricing Engine**
  - Real-time surge activation zone heatmap
  - Fare estimate vs actual fare delta per trip
  - Forecast error for demand curves (MAPE) by region

- **ETA & Routing Engine**
  - ETA prediction error grouped by pickup zone and time bucket
  - Routing success rate for different transport modes (bike, car, shared, EV)
  - Retries for external mapping API integrations

### c. ML/Model Monitoring
- **Model Serving (Triton/Custom)**
  - Inference latency for models: `eta_predictor`, `demand_forecaster`, `fraud_model`
  - Real-time traffic of prediction endpoints by city and user class
  - Failure rate for predictions across hardware tier (CPU vs GPU-backed)

- **Feature Store Dashboards**
  - Last update time for key features: `driver_rating_agg`, `pickup_heat_score`
  - Missing value % by source (Kafka vs batch pipeline)

### d. Data Platform
- **Kafka Stream Monitoring**
  - Lag and throughput for key topics: `ride.created`, `driver.location`, `pricing.surge`
  - Alert for consumer group stalls or offset mismatches (e.g., pricing cache delay)

- **DBT & Analytics Pipelines**
  - Model freshness and job duration across `rider_insights`, `city_kpi_agg`
  - Data quality test failure trendlines (e.g., null trip fares, duplicate events)

---

## 2. Visualization Tools
- Grafana for infra, Kubernetes, ML inference, Kafka
- Datadog for SLO dashboards, service metrics, and logs
- Superset for ops team–facing dashboards (e.g., cancellations per city, fleet utilization)

---

## 3. Dashboard Standards
- Tags per panel: `env`, `region`, `service`, `tenant`, `fleet_id`, `rider_type`
- Embed red/yellow/green indicators tied to SLOs (e.g., match latency < 2s P95)
- Include direct links to service logs, runbooks, and last deployment commit hash
- All dashboards source-controlled in `/dashboards/` and versioned with GitOps workflow

---

## 4. Ownership & Governance
- Every dashboard owned by a RideShareApp product domain team (e.g., `ETA`, `Driver Matching`, `Fleet Ops`)
- Dashboards reviewed quarterly during platform on-call retros and ML monitoring reviews
- Critical dashboards must be:
  - Linked in service READMEs
  - Accessible via centralized observability portal
  - Accompanied by Grafana UID and access roles

---

## Summary
Standardized observability dashboards provide real-time visibility and operational resilience across the RideShareApp Platform. From pricing model drift to routing accuracy and surge zone forecasting, these dashboards empower engineering, data, and ops teams to maintain system-wide reliability and optimize rider and driver experience.

### c. ML/Model Monitoring
- **Model Serving**
  - Inference latency by model type
  - Success/error rate per endpoint
  - QPS breakdown by input type (rider, fleet)

- **Feature Freshness**
  - Last update timestamp per feature table

---

## 2. Visualization Tools
- Primary dashboard platforms:
  - Grafana for service, infra, ML
  - Datadog for unified metrics/logs/traces
  - Superset for analytical summaries

---

## 3. Dashboard Standards
- Standard labels: `env`, `service`, `tenant`, `region`, `release_tag`
- Include SLA reference lines for critical metrics
- Embed links to alert definitions, runbooks, and service logs
- Promote dashboard-as-code via YAML in GitHub (e.g., via Grafana JSON templates)

---

## 4. Ownership & Governance
- Each dashboard must have an owning team
- Dashboards reviewed during on-call retros
- Critical dashboards pinned in observability portal and linked from service README

---

## Summary
Standardized observability dashboards provide transparency, operational rigor, and system-wide visibility for the RideShareApp Platform. They support rapid root cause analysis, SLO tracking, and cross-team collaboration in production environments.
