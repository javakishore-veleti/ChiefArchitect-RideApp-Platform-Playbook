# API Gateway Policies â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define unified API gateway policies that ensure consistent enforcement of authentication, rate limiting, observability, and versioning for all public and internal APIs across the RideShareApp platform.

---

## Gateway Architecture Overview
- API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Envoy, or AWS API Gateway) fronts all external and internal service APIs.
- Traffic is routed based on domain segmentation: Rider, Driver, Partner, Operations, ML
- Gateways support plugin-based and declarative policies

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] All public-facing APIs must use OAuth2.0 with short-lived tokens
- [ ] Internal APIs must support mTLS between microservices
- [ ] Partner APIs require HMAC signing and scoped API keys
- [ ] Role-based access policies enforced via gateway JWT introspection plugin

---

## 2. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- [ ] Per-consumer limits for partner/public APIs (e.g., 1000 RPM per app ID)
- [ ] Burst limits configured for specific endpoints (e.g., surge calculator)
- [ ] Quotas tracked daily for external developers via API key
- [ ] Graceful throttling with informative HTTP 429 + Retry-After headers

---

## 3. Observability & Logging
- [ ] All gateway traffic is logged with request ID, client ID, and status codes
- [ ] Metrics exported to Prometheus: latency, error rate, QPS per route
- [ ] Logs streamed to ELK/CloudWatch/Datadog for aggregation
- [ ] Audit trails persisted for security events and policy exceptions

---

## 4. Caching & Response Handling
- [ ] Static metadata responses (e.g., city configs, TOS) cached for 5 mins
- [ ] Signed surge pricing results cached for short TTL (e.g., 15 seconds)
- [ ] Circuit breakers configured for downstream latency spikes
- [ ] Automatic fallback for retryable errors from core services

---

## 5. Versioning & Deprecation
- [ ] Version in path or header required (e.g., `/v1/driver/earnings`)
- [ ] Deprecation warnings returned with appropriate headers
- [ ] EOL schedules documented and communicated via developer portal
- [ ] Canary rollout supported via traffic splitting rules

---

## 6. Security & Abuse Protection
- [ ] WAF policies enforced at edge (e.g., IP whitelisting, SQL injection filters)
- [ ] Threat detection rules for bot/spam traffic with ML-based heuristics
- [ ] API key abuse detection triggers alert via Slack/Email
- [ ] ReCAPTCHA integration for public form endpoints

---

## 7. Developer Experience
- [ ] Auto-generated OpenAPI specs for all documented routes
- [ ] Public APIs published in API Portal with usage examples
- [ ] Postman collections maintained per domain
- [ ] Rate limit status and token validity included in response headers

---

## Governance & Ownership
- [ ] All routes must have a service owner annotated via tagging (`team`, `tier`, `SLA`)
- [ ] Changes to route config require PR + approval from domain owner
- [ ] Gateway policy changes are version-controlled and reviewed monthly

---

## Summary
API Gateway Policies in RideShareApp ensure consistent, secure, and observable service interaction across all clients. This document acts as the enforcement contract across engineering, infrastructure, and security teams to keep platform interfaces resilient, discoverable, and governed.
