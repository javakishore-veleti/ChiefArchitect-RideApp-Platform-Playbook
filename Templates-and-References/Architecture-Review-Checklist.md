# Architecture Review Checklist – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Provide a structured, repeatable checklist to evaluate proposed system designs and architecture changes in the RideShareApp Platform. This ensures alignment with platform-wide principles, resilience, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Business & Product Alignment
- [ ] Does the architecture clearly support a specific product or platform goal?
- [ ] Are business KPIs traceable from system responsibilities?
- [ ] Have impacted stakeholders reviewed or signed off?

## 2. Domain Modeling & Ownership
- [ ] Are domain boundaries clear and mapped to team ownership?
- [ ] Are bounded contexts or aggregates defined (if using DDD)?
- [ ] Does this impact other teams/domains that must be coordinated?

## 3. Communication & Contracts
- [ ] Are API protocols and schemas (REST/gRPC/GraphQL) clearly defined?
- [ ] Are versioning and backward compatibility strategies documented?
- [ ] Will this interface be published in the developer portal with ownership metadata?

## 4. Data Architecture
- [ ] Is data model normalized or denormalized as needed for scale?
- [ ] Are data retention, archival, and deletion policies defined?
- [ ] Are regulatory constraints (PII, PCI, GDPR) satisfied?
- [ ] Are source-of-truth systems clearly identified?

## 5. Resilience, Availability & Scaling
- [ ] What are the expected QPS and latency SLAs?
- [ ] Have fallback mechanisms, retries, and circuit breakers been designed?
- [ ] Are there potential SPOFs (single points of failure)?
- [ ] Can the system scale horizontally or shard by tenant/zone?

## 6. Observability & Monitoring
- [ ] Are metrics, logs, and traces instrumented and tagged by service/request ID?
- [ ] Are dashboards and alerts specified for the new components?
- [ ] Will this impact SLOs or alert thresholds elsewhere?

## 7. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Is authentication handled (e.g., OAuth2, mTLS)?
- [ ] Have authorization rules been scoped and audited?
- [ ] Are input validations, rate limiting, and WAF protection applied?
- [ ] Does it adhere to existing platform security blueprints?

## 8. Deployment, CI/CD, and Rollback
- [ ] Are Helm, Terraform, or Kustomize specs defined?
- [ ] Is there a blue/green or canary rollout plan?
- [ ] Are all changes reviewed by SRE/infra team before production?
- [ ] What’s the rollback and hotfix protocol?

## 9. ML/AI Integration (if applicable)
- [ ] Are models versioned, monitored, and rollback-capable?
- [ ] Are inference SLAs met under production load?
- [ ] Is explainability or fairness required for this use case?
- [ ] Are feature pipelines or real-time signals reused or duplicated?

## 10. Tradeoffs, Risks, and Open Questions
- [ ] Have architectural tradeoffs been documented?
- [ ] What technical debt is incurred or addressed?
- [ ] Are open questions identified with follow-up owners?
- [ ] Has an ADR been created and linked?

## Review Process
- Review led by architecture committee or designated lead
- Checklist reviewed collaboratively via PR or design doc comments
- Approvals tracked and stored in the Architecture Review Log

## Summary
This checklist enables consistent architectural rigor while adapting to the real-time, multi-tenant, ML-enhanced nature of the RideShareApp platform. It improves design quality, mitigates risks early, and drives shared responsibility across teams.
