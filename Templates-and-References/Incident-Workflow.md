# Incident Workflow â€“ RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define the standard workflow for detecting, managing, resolving, and learning from production incidents across the RideShareApp Platform. Ensures minimal user disruption, clear communication, and continuous improvement.

---

## 1. Incident Severity Levels
| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| SEV-1 | Critical outage, affects riders/drivers globally | Booking failures, pricing engine down |
| SEV-2 | Partial degradation, regional or scoped | Delays in ETA prediction in one region |
| SEV-3 | Minor degradation, recoverable | Logs missing for one service, cache drift |
| SEV-4 | No user impact, internal alert only | Retry rate increase, stale metrics |

---

## 2. Detection & Alerting
- Alerts configured in Datadog, Prometheus, Sentry
- On-call engineers notified via PagerDuty (with escalation policies)
- Alerts must include:
  - Service name and severity
  - Dashboard and log links
  - Runbook reference

---

## 3. Incident Response Roles
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Incident Commander (IC) | Leads coordination, escalation, status updates |
| Scribe | Takes notes, timelines, captures decisions |
| Subject Matter Experts | Investigate, mitigate, and recover service |
| Comms Lead | Communicates with stakeholders and execs |

---

## 4. Communication Workflow
- Internal Slack channels: `#rideapp-incident-sevX`
- External comms: status page updates, customer support pings
- Zoom/Meet bridge started for active SEV-1/SEV-2s
- Post hourly (SEV-1) or EOD (SEV-2) updates with impact + ETA

---

## 5. Mitigation & Recovery
- Apply temporary mitigations (feature flag, scaleout, cache invalidation)
- Escalate to infra/vendor teams if root cause is external
- Perform rollback if recent change is causal
- Validate downstream health post-recovery

---

## 6. Post-Incident Review (PIR)
- Must be held within 5 business days
- Blameless write-up includes:
  - Timeline of events
  - Impacted services/users/metrics
  - Root cause
  - Resolution and mitigation
  - Follow-up action items
- Stored in Confluence/GitHub under `postmortems/`

---

## 7. Prevention & Follow-Up
- All action items assigned with owners + due dates
- Alerting thresholds and dashboards reviewed/updated
- Runbook gaps filled and service-level README updated
- Patterns shared via `#platform-learnings`

---

## Tooling Integrations
- Slack + PagerDuty + Datadog triage bundles
- GitHub Issues for action item tracking
- Runbook links in dashboards and alert metadata

---

## Summary
A clear incident workflow ensures reliability and resilience at scale for the RideShareApp platform. This protocol enables fast recovery, coordinated response, and data-driven prevention of future outages.
