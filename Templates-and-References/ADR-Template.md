# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template – RideShareApp Platform

## Title
_Example: Standardize on gRPC for Inter-Service Communication in RideShareApp Platform_

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-###]

## Context
_What is the specific platform context and problem this decision addresses?_

Example:
As the RideShareApp Platform scales across multiple zones and services (rider management, driver matching, surge pricing, ETA prediction, fraud detection), we face inconsistencies in service-to-service communication patterns. REST/JSON introduces latency overhead and lacks schema enforcement, impacting real-time SLAs critical to pricing and dispatch layers.

## Decision
_What architectural path are we taking and why does it suit RideShareApp?_ 

Example:
We adopt **gRPC + Protobuf** as the standard for all internal microservice APIs. This supports our multi-tenant, latency-sensitive architecture and ensures robust schema enforcement with backward/forward compatibility.

## Consequences
_Positive and negative implications in RideShareApp context_

**Positive:**
- Predictable low-latency communication for real-time services
- Interoperability with service discovery and observability tooling (Envoy, OpenTelemetry)
- Encourages schema-first design in platform evolution

**Negative:**
- Steeper learning curve for non-Go/Java developers
- Need for REST/gRPC translation layers for frontend and partner-facing APIs
- Extra operational effort to manage IDL and interface evolution across repos

## Alternatives Considered
- **REST/JSON**: Higher adoption but verbose and not type-safe; impacts prediction latency
- **GraphQL**: Better suited for frontend aggregation, not internal service hops
- **Apache Thrift**: Similar benefits but less traction and toolchain complexity

## Implementation Details
- Define `.proto` contracts in `rideapp-api-specs`
- Codegen for Go, Java, and TypeScript clients via CI pipelines
- Introduce `grpc-health` and `grpc-reflection` endpoints for ops tooling
- Mandatory backward compatibility checks on schema evolution

# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template

## Title
_Example: Choose gRPC over REST for Internal Microservice Communication_

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-###]

## Context
_What is the business, technical, or architectural context motivating this decision?_

Example:
To enable low-latency, contract-driven communication between internal services in the ride app platform, we need to choose a communication protocol. Our current system uses REST, but latency and payload size are limiting performance.

## Decision
_What decision has been made and why?_

Example:
We will use **gRPC** with protocol buffers (Protobuf) for all internal service-to-service communication. It provides bi-directional streaming, smaller payloads, and strong typing, improving efficiency and developer productivity.

## Consequences
_What are the positive and negative consequences of this decision?_

Positive:
- Improved latency and serialization performance
- Easier interface evolution via Protobuf
- Tooling for automated client generation

Negative:
- Requires new onboarding and developer education
- Adds dependency on gRPC ecosystem (e.g., Envoy, interceptors)
- Limited browser-native support (must use REST gateway or gRPC-Web)

## Alternatives Considered
_What other options were considered and why were they not chosen?_

- REST/JSON: familiar, but verbose and slower
- GraphQL: flexible but heavier for strict contracts
- Apache Thrift: comparable to gRPC, but lower adoption in our ecosystem
