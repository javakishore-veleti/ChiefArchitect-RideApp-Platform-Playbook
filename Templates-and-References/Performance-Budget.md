# Performance Budget – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define performance budget guidelines to proactively monitor and constrain service latency, resource usage, and application responsiveness across the RideShareApp Platform—spanning user-facing applications, backend services, and ML inference APIs.

---

## 1. Scope of Budgets
- **Mobile and Web Clients**:
  - Initial page load / app boot
  - API response latency
  - Device resource impact (battery, memory, storage)

- **Backend Services**:
  - API and gRPC latency (P50/P95/P99)
  - CPU and memory usage
  - Concurrency limits and queuing behavior

- **ML Inference Systems**:
  - Model inference latency
  - Cold start time (if using serverless)
  - Feature store read delays

## 2. Example Budget Targets (per component)

| Component                | P95 Latency | CPU Limit | Memory Limit | Notes |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Rider Booking API        | < 300 ms    | 500m      | 512Mi        | Includes surge and match logic |
| ETA Prediction Service   | < 400 ms    | 1 vCPU    | 1Gi          | Batched inputs supported |
| Driver Location Tracker  | < 150 ms    | 200m      | 256Mi        | High-frequency Kafka consumer |
| Pricing Engine           | < 250 ms    | 750m      | 768Mi        | Dynamic fare + coupon logic |
| Rider App Home Load      | < 1000 ms   | -         | -            | Bundle, preload APIs, cache strategy |

---

## 3. Budget Ownership
- Budgets owned per domain team (e.g., Rider, Driver, Pricing, ETA, Fraud)
- Each team must define and publish budget metrics via SLO dashboards
- Budgets enforced as acceptance criteria for new features

---

## 4. Monitoring & Enforcement
- Metrics emitted via OpenTelemetry / Datadog
- Budgets tracked via SLO dashboards and auto-alerts
- PRs introducing regressions >10% must document reason and timeline to remediate
- Canary analysis compares budget performance pre/post-deploy

---

## 5. CI/CD Integration
- Add regression thresholds to integration tests (e.g., latency delta > threshold)
- Block production deployment if budget violation exceeds policy
- Record budget drift trends across release tags for root cause analysis

---

## 6. Mobile Optimization Strategies
- Lightweight payloads (< 100KB compressed)
- Use of GraphQL or BFF to avoid over-fetching
- Caching (HTTP, local storage, indexedDB)
- Lazy loading and native image formats (AVIF, WebP)

---

## Summary
Performance budgets help RideShareApp teams prioritize reliability and responsiveness at every layer of the stack. These constraints protect user experience under load, provide feedback loops during development, and support a culture of engineering excellence through quantitative thresholds.
