# Deployment Topology – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Describe the multi-region, multi-zone deployment strategy and logical topology of the RideShareApp platform. Ensure services are resilient, scalable, and optimized for low latency and fault isolation.

---

## 1. Global Deployment Model
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (primary), GCP (select ML workloads)
- **Regions:** `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-south-1`
- **Availability Zones per Region:** Minimum 2 (Zonal Redundancy)
- **Traffic Entry Points:** Anycast DNS + Global CDN (CloudFront/Fastly)

---

## 2. Core Platform Services
- **Stateless Services:**
  - Deployed as horizontally scaled pods behind regional ALBs
  - Examples: `rider-api`, `driver-api`, `pricing-engine`, `dispatch-service`
- **Stateful Components:**
  - Zonal deployments with multi-AZ failover (RDS, Kafka, DynamoDB)
  - Replication managed via native cloud tooling (Aurora, MSK, ElastiCache)

---

## 3. ML & Data Workloads
- **Model Inference:**
  - Online models hosted via GPU-backed ECS/EKS in region
  - Offline batch scoring via EMR/SageMaker Batch or Dataproc
- **Feature Stores:**
  - Online: Redis/DynamoDB, zonal consistency
  - Offline: BigQuery/S3-based for retraining pipelines

---

## 4. Networking & Service Mesh
- **Inter-service Communication:**
  - Envoy-based service mesh for observability and retries
  - TLS by default with mTLS enforcement
- **Service Discovery:**
  - Cloud-native (e.g., AWS Cloud Map) + mesh registry
- **North-South Traffic:**
  - Routed through API Gateway with WAF policies and rate limiting

---

## 5. Multi-Tenancy & Isolation
- **Tenant Routing:**
  - By token header (multi-tenant) or VPC/network boundaries (enterprise)
- **Isolation Patterns:**
  - Namespaced Kubernetes clusters
  - Dedicated Kafka topics, S3 prefixes, and IAM roles

---

## 6. CI/CD and Release Topology
- **Staging → Canary → Production** flow via GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- Canary deployed to one AZ/region with 1–5% traffic weight
- Blue/Green or rolling deployments per service tier
- Traffic shifting automated and observable via LaunchDarkly/Flipt

---

## 7. Observability
- **Metrics:** Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog
- **Logs:** Centralized ELK + regional fluentd aggregators
- **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry + Grafana Tempo
- **Dashboards:** Per service, per region, per tenant

---

## 8. Disaster Recovery & Failover
- **Backup Strategy:** Automated snapshots for DBs, object storage, state
- **DR Regions:** Warm standby in alternate regions (e.g., `us-west-2` for `us-east-1`)
- **Failover Mechanism:** DNS failover + traffic drain/fence via Terraform automation
- **Test Cadence:** Quarterly chaos drills and DR runbooks reviewed

---

## Summary
The RideShareApp deployment topology ensures global performance, resilience, and agility. By combining region-aware deployments, service mesh observability, and automated CI/CD, the platform maintains reliability under high scale and continuous change.
