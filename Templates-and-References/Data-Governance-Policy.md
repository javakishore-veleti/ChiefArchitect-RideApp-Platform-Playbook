# Data Governance Policy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a clear and enforceable data governance framework for the RideShareApp Platform that ensures responsible data handling, regulatory compliance, data quality, and trusted data access across platform services such as ride bookings, driver analytics, pricing intelligence, ETA forecasting, and fleet operations.

---

## 1. Data Stewardship Model
- Assign **Data Owners** for key platform domains:
  - Rider Activity, Trip Bookings, Surge Pricing, Driver Incentives, Partner Fleet Ops
- Define **Data Stewards** responsible for metadata curation and access control
- Maintain ownership metadata in the RideShareApp metadata catalog (e.g., DataHub)

---

## 2. Data Classification
- All data collected via Rider apps, Driver apps, and Ops dashboards must be classified:
  - **Public**: Route density heatmaps, aggregated zone stats
  - **Internal**: Matching latency metrics, driver availability logs
  - **Confidential**: Dynamic pricing parameters, fleet payout formulas
  - **PII/Sensitive**: Rider name, phone, geo-coordinates, driver license number
- Classification is enforced via schema tags and pipeline annotations

---

## 3. Access Policies
- Role-based access for internal personas:
  - Ops Analysts (read-only)
  - Data Scientists (exploratory access to curated marts)
  - Engineers (service-specific write access)
- Access to driver/rider-level data requires security group approval and audit trail
- All access requests are filed through the internal `data-access-request` portal

---

## 4. Regulatory Compliance
- Compliance with region-specific mobility data rules:
  - **GDPR** for European Rider location and trip data
  - **CCPA** for California-based driver earnings and trip history
  - **PDPB** for India operations (zone-level data localization)
  - PCI DSS for Rider app payments and Wallet services
- Maintain up-to-date DPAs with all 3rd-party analytics vendors
- Enable deletion pipelines for Rider/Driver opt-out requests

---

## 5. Metadata and Lineage
- All datasets (e.g., `ride_events`, `driver_incentive_events`, `fare_estimates`) must:
  - Be registered in DataHub with schema ownership
  - Track field-level lineage from source (Kafka, RDS, S3) to consumer (BigQuery, dbt)
  - Include descriptions, SLAs, and retention policies

---

## 6. Data Quality & Monitoring
- Use Great Expectations + Monte Carlo to:
  - Monitor nulls, duplicates, distribution drift in Rider feedback & Trip logs
  - Set freshness SLAs on ML features for ETA, surge, driver availability
  - Trigger alerts when zone-level anomalies exceed thresholds (e.g., trip volume dips)

---

## 7. Retention & Deletion
- Retention policy by category:
  - Logs/metrics (30 days)
  - Experimental ML datasets (180 days)
  - Regulatory data (7 years)
- Implement deletion jobs for:
  - Expired driver accounts
  - Inactive rider trip history
  - PII purges (based on user data deletion API calls)

---

## 8. Tooling
- Metadata Catalog: DataHub with Slack-based lookup bot
- Quality Monitoring: Great Expectations, Airflow alerts
- Access Control: IAM with Immuta policy layer
- Governance as Code: dbt docs, YAML-based data contracts stored in GitHub

---

## 9. Governance Board & Auditing
- Monthly governance reviews covering:
  - High-risk data usage (e.g., driver re-identification risk)
  - Newly introduced PII fields in trip schema
  - Open access grant violations
- Quarterly audits of schema drift, data access patterns, vendor compliance

---

## Summary
The RideShareApp Data Governance Policy ensures structured, responsible use of rider and driver data at scale. It balances velocity of product experimentation with strict compliance, giving the platform a reliable foundation for real-time ML, ops analytics, and business intelligence.


# Data Governance Policy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a clear and enforceable data governance framework for the RideShareApp Platform that ensures responsible data handling, regulatory compliance, data quality, and trusted data access across the organization.

---

## 1. Data Stewardship Model
- Assign **Data Owners** per domain (e.g., Rider, Driver, Pricing, Operations)
- Define **Data Stewards** responsible for metadata curation and access control
- Maintain ownership registry in a centralized metadata catalog (e.g., Amundsen, DataHub)

---

## 2. Data Classification
- Data must be labeled into:
  - **Public**: Safe for open exposure (e.g., city-level surge trends)
  - **Internal**: Operational metrics, logs, configs
  - **Confidential**: Business KPIs, aggregated pricing data
  - **PII/Sensitive**: Names, emails, locations, payment info
- Enforced via schema annotations, storage bucket tags, and table-level labels

---

## 3. Access Policies
- Role-based access control (RBAC) via identity provider (e.g., Okta, IAM)
- All sensitive data access must be approved and audited
- Data mart access provided by persona: Analyst, Data Scientist, Engineer
- Data access requests logged in an auditable approval workflow

---

## 4. Regulatory Compliance
- Policies enforce:
  - **GDPR** (EU) and **CCPA** (California) right to access/delete
  - **PDPB** (India) data localization
  - PCI DSS for payment-related tables
- Maintain data processing agreements (DPAs) for third-party processors
- Maintain breach notification runbooks and PII incident response

---

## 5. Metadata and Lineage
- All data sources registered in the enterprise metadata system
- Schema evolution tracked and versioned
- Data lineage captured via ingestion pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Kafka Connect)
- Column-level documentation required for all trusted datasets

---

## 6. Data Quality & Monitoring
- Implement data freshness SLAs and anomaly detection
- Define acceptance thresholds for completeness, validity, accuracy
- Publish quality scorecards per domain and dataset
- Automated alerts for schema drift or null value spikes

---

## 7. Retention & Deletion
- Default data retention:
  - 30 days for logs/metrics
  - 180 days for derived models and experiments
  - 7 years for financial or regulated datasets
- Scheduled deletion jobs enforce retention policy
- Support subject erasure (right to be forgotten) workflows

---

## 8. Tooling
- Catalog: Amundsen / DataHub / Collibra
- Quality: Great Expectations, Monte Carlo
- Access: Immuta, Okera, Privacera
- Governance Layer: dbt + GitOps-managed YAML policies

---

## 9. Governance Board & Auditing
- Monthly governance review forum with Data Engineering, Legal, Security
- Data policy changes tracked in GitHub with peer review
- Quarterly internal audits of access logs and compliance posture

---

## Summary
This Data Governance Policy ensures that RideShareApp Platform data is discoverable, trustworthy, and securely handled throughout its lifecycle. It promotes responsible data practices, meets compliance needs, and empowers analytics and ML at scale.
