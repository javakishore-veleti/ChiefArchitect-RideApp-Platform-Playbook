# Change Management – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a lightweight yet reliable change management process tailored for the RideShareApp Platform—balancing velocity and innovation with traceability, service stability, and platform-wide coordination.

---

## 1. Principles
- **Decentralized, Governed Autonomy**: Teams move fast within golden paths but align on shared platform standards.
- **Prevention Over Policing**: Changes are validated through CI, linters, fitness functions—not just approvals.
- **Impact-Aware Rollouts**: All changes include impact classification (customer-facing, infra, internal ops).

---

## 2. Change Categories
| Type               | Examples                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1 - Critical  | Trip matching algorithm, Rider app release, Pricing engine config       |
| Tier 2 - Infra     | Service mesh upgrades, DB schema changes, secrets rotation              |
| Tier 3 - Routine   | Internal dashboard fixes, config toggles, background job retries        |

Each category determines:
- Review depth (e.g., Architecture Review Board for Tier 1)
- Rollout gates (e.g., canary, blue-green)
- On-call notification requirements

---

## 3. Change Lifecycle
1. **Proposal** (for Tier 1 or Tier 2)
   - Use `change-proposal.yaml`
   - Reviewed in weekly Change Control Forum (CCF)

2. **Pre-deploy Validations**
   - Linting, policy checks, SLO regression testing
   - Updated runbooks & rollback plans

3. **Rollout & Observability**
   - Canary & metrics dashboards
   - Slack notifications to relevant SRE + Domain channels

4. **Post-deploy Review**
   - Rollback if metrics regress
   - Change ticket closure with annotations

---

## 4. Governance Roles
- **Domain Leads**: Review Tier 1 impact changes
- **Platform SRE**: Owns deployment automation & rollback strategy
- **Engineering Managers**: Approve post-deploy validation artifacts
- **Change Control Forum**: Cross-domain reps + architects for major change arbitration

---

## 5. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Auto-populate `change-proposal.yaml` from Backstage metadata
- **Q3**: Real-time deploy feed with SLO regression overlays in Grafana
- **Q4**: ChatOps integration to approve/reject low-risk changes via Slack threads

---

## Summary
Change Management at RideShareApp enables confident delivery at scale. By stratifying change risk, embedding validations, and leveraging observability tooling, teams deploy with clarity, safety, and alignment—without unnecessary friction.
