# DevSecOps Maturity Assessment – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a DevSecOps maturity model specific to the RideShareApp Platform that enables squads to self-assess, benchmark, and continuously improve their integration of security throughout the software development and operations lifecycle.

## 1. DevSecOps Pillars
| Pillar            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shift Left        | Security integrated early in design, code review, and CI pipelines          |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Guardrails and OPA policies embedded in Terraform, Helm, and ArgoCD   |
| Runtime Protection| Monitor, alert, and auto-mitigate anomalous behavior in services            |
| Secrets Hygiene   | Automated detection, rotation, and vault-backed access                      |
| SBOM & Dependency Control | Provenance tracking and risk scoring of all third-party components   |

## 2. Maturity Levels
| Level | Description                                              | Indicators                                                    |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Reactive Security                                         | Manual reviews, no SAST/DAST, secrets in code                 |
| 2     | Defined Practices                                         | Basic CI linting, documented playbooks, OWASP training        |
| 3     | Integrated Guardrails                                     | IaC policies, secrets scanning, pre-merge threat detection    |
| 4     | Continuous Risk Monitoring                                | SBOMs, real-time alerts, security posture dashboards          |
| 5     | Autonomous & Preventive                                   | Self-healing controls, zero-trust enforcement, supply chain attestation |

## 3. RideShareApp Platform Focus Areas
| Domain            | Examples Specific to RideShareApp                                              |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rider & Driver APIs| Ensure PII access logs are immutable and queryable                             |
| Pricing Services   | Validate inputs for injection/fuzz risk; use context-aware model validation    |
| Trip Booking       | Session replay protection, payment API threat modeling                         |
| CI/CD Pipelines    | GitHub Actions signed builds, SBOM artifacts pushed to central registry        |
| Edge Services      | WAF policies enforced for Rider App and Driver SDK                             |

## 4. Assessment Template (per squad)
```yaml
service_name: eta-model
team: marketplace-insights
maturity_level: 3
last_reviewed: 2025-06-01
focus_gaps:
  - no automated SBOM verification
  - secrets checked into old repo versions
next_actions:
  - enable SBOM scan in CI
  - rotate secrets and add vault integration
owners:
  - lead_engineer: ramesh.k@rideshareapp.com
  - secchampion: priya.n@rideshareapp.com
```

## 5. Governance
- **Security Champions Program**: Each domain team nominates 1+ security leads
- **Quarterly Assessments**: Platform security team facilitates maturity scoring
- **Scorecard Dashboard**: Service-level heatmap shared in Backstage plugin
- **Follow-up Audits**: Targeted checks post-incident or after Tier 1 feature launches
