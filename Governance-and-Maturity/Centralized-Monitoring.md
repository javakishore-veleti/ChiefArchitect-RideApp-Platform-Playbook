# Centralized Monitoring Policy – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a centralized, resilient, and action-oriented monitoring strategy for the RideShareApp Platform to ensure end-to-end visibility, proactive anomaly detection, and platform-wide observability consistency.

---

## 1. Monitoring Scope
| Domain                 | Monitored Elements                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Core Platform Services | Trip Booking, Pricing Engine, ETA, Rider Match, Notifications              |
| ML & Personalization   | Model latency, inference success rates, feature drift                      |
| Infra & Kubernetes     | Pod health, autoscaler behavior, service mesh telemetry (Envoy, Istio)     |
| Mobile & Frontend      | App crash rates, latency by region, error frequency                        |
| Data Pipelines         | DAG failures, batch delay, feature store sync status                       |

---

## 2. Observability Stack
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Thanos for high-resolution, long-retention time series
- **Logs**: Fluent Bit → GCP Logging → BigQuery sinks + retention by region
- **Traces**: OpenTelemetry to export from mobile and backend into Grafana Tempo
- **Dashboards**: Grafana, Looker, and Redash federated across domains
- **Alerting**: AlertManager → PagerDuty (Tier 1) / Slack + Email (Tiers 2 & 3)

---

## 3. Policy Requirements
- All **Tier 1** services must emit:
  - **RED Metrics** (Rate, Error, Duration) at endpoint level
  - Custom **business metrics** (e.g., booking failures, surge match counts)
  - Traces linked to **trace_id** propagated from mobile → backend → DB

- **SLIs + SLOs** must be defined per capability with weekly validation via SLO dashboards
- **Alert Fatigue** Prevention:
  - No alert without runbook link
  - Auto-suppression based on change windows and deployments

---

## 4. Dashboards by Persona
| Persona              | Views Enabled                                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SRE/Infra            | Node health, pod OOMs, throttling, region saturation                         |
| App Engineers        | Endpoint latency, 4xx/5xx APIs, crash analytics                             |
| Product Managers     | Booking success funnel, trip completions, cancellation rates                |
| Data Scientists      | Feature freshness, drift metrics, model version comparisons                  |
| Leadership           | Aggregated uptime, incident count by domain, cost overlays                  |

---

## 5. Runbook and Alert Integration
- All alerts must link to versioned **runbooks** (via Backstage plugin or Confluence)
- Playbooks include:
  - Fallback strategy
  - Known issues & JIRA link
  - Escalation tree (Engineering Manager, SRE, TPM)

---

## 6. Governance
- **Monitoring Review Board** meets monthly to audit alert coverage
- Dashboards and alerts reviewed during **Release Readiness Reviews**
- **SLI Drift Reports** auto-generated for any 5-day anomaly trend

---

## Summary
A centralized monitoring policy anchors operational excellence at RideShareApp. From pod health to user behavior, our strategy ensures platform observability is consistent, actionable, and aligned with business SLAs across all domains.
