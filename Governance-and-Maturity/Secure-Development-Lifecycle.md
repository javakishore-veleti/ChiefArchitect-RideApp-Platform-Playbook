# Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) tailored to the **RideShareApp Platform**, ensuring security, compliance, and privacy are embedded at every software delivery phase—from trip booking to ML-powered ETA predictions.

## 1. SDL Phases & Controls
| Phase            | Key SDL Activities (RideShareApp-Specific)                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements     | PIAs for features like real-time tracking, background checks, regional trip compliance flags |
| Design           | STRIDE modeling for trip workflows, API contract validation for fare & location endpoints |
| Development      | Secure Rider & Driver App SDK coding guidelines, secret scan pre-commit hooks for CI YAMLs |
| Build & CI/CD    | Auto-enforced IaC policies for deployment to regional clusters (e.g. India zone), SBOM tagging by geo |
| Testing          | Pen testing harnesses for surge pricing APIs, fuzzing rider ID/token injection |
| Deployment       | Canary rollouts for pricing and ETA microservices; config secrets pulled from Vault via service mesh sidecar |
| Operations       | Detection of drift in location schema definitions, anomaly alerts in fraud pipeline logs |
| Monitoring       | SLO dashboards for sensitive flows (driver earnings), PII access audit log with domain tagging |

## 2. SDL Toolchain
- **Code Quality & Linting**: SonarQube for Rider/Driver App services, PR gate lint rules for location APIs
- **Secrets Hygiene**: GitGuardian integration on RideShareApp GitHub repos; Vault audit logs linked to Slack alerts
- **Policy-as-Code**: OPA for validating geo-partitioned Terraform modules; Checkov in Rider trip infra pipeline
- **SBOM & Dependency Management**: Signed SBOMs required for any service interacting with trip, payment, or partner APIs
- **Dynamic App Security**: ZAP integrated in Rider App CI for frontend vulnerabilities; mobile SDK pen tests biannually
- **Model Risk Checks**: Automated security regression testing on ETA and fraud detection models

## 3. Security Gates by Service Tier
| Service Tier | Security Gate Examples                                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1       | Booking, Pricing, Matching services – require pen test, ADR review, SLO dashboards |
| Tier 2       | Notification, Profile APIs – require SAST, CI policy validation, secrets audit     |
| Tier 3       | Internal admin tools – follow SDL with light-weight review templates               |

---

## 4. Developer Enablement
- **Backstage SDL Plugin**: Tracks SDL readiness for services like `trip-router`, `eta-model`, `payment-engine`
- **SDL Maturity Scorecard**: Live status dashboard shared across squads per quarterly platform review
- **Engineering Handbook**: RideShareApp-specific SDL patterns for regional deployments, secure webhook handling
- **Champions Program**: At least one SDL-trained Security Champion per engineering vertical (e.g. Payments, Marketplace)

---

## 5. Governance and Review
- **SDL Council**: Monthly reviews with Platform Security, Infra, and Compliance on high-risk launches (e.g., new driver onboarding APIs)
- **Audit Schedule**: Bi-annual reviews of SDL controls on all Tier 1 production-facing microservices
- **Retro Loop**: RCA learnings from incidents (e.g. partner API overexposure) updated in SDL gates

---

## Summary
The Secure Development Lifecycle at RideShareApp Platform is embedded into our delivery DNA—powering safe mobility, rider trust, and system resilience. From service mesh routing to ML-powered personalization, SDL ensures security isn’t a checkpoint—it’s a continuous, contextualized commitment.


# Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) tailored to the RideShareApp Platform that ensures security, compliance, and privacy are baked into every phase of the software delivery lifecycle—from concept through continuous delivery.
