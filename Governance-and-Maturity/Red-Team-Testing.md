# Red Team and Penetration Testing Cadence – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a strategic, recurring penetration testing and red teaming program for the RideShareApp Platform that uncovers real-world vulnerabilities across APIs, mobile apps, infrastructure, and ML-powered services—before adversaries do.

## 1. Testing Scope
| Domain              | In-Scope Assets                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rider & Driver Apps | Mobile app binaries, API tokens, auth/session flows, SDK integrations          |
| Platform APIs       | Pricing, ETA, Trip Booking, Notifications, Payment, Matching, Profile APIs     |
| Admin & Backoffice  | Support tooling, internal dashboards, config portals                            |
| ML Pipelines        | Model exposure via inference APIs, feature stores, data poisoning surfaces      |
| Infra & DevOps      | CI/CD pipelines, GitHub repos, secrets vaults, ingress policies                 |

## 2. Cadence and Strategy
| Activity               | Frequency     | Owner              | Description                                                      |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| External Pen Test      | Semi-annually | Security Engineering | Performed by 3rd-party CREST-certified vendors on live systems   |
| Internal Red Team Ops  | Quarterly     | Internal Red Team   | Realistic attack simulations, lateral movement & pivoting        |
| Bug Bounty Triage      | Continuous    | Security Platform   | Ongoing review of submissions via HackerOne/BugCrowd             |
| Targeted Deep Dives    | As-needed     | AppSec & InfraSec   | Focused on authz, session mgmt, or specific partner integrations |

## 3. Methodologies
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10**: Applied to Rider/Driver apps and companion SDKs
- **OWASP API Security Top 10**: Mapped to every public API exposed by the platform
- **STRIDE & MITRE ATT&CK**: Guides internal red team scenarios and coverage tracking
- **Custom ML Threat Model**: Model extraction, adversarial examples, shadow training detection

## 4. Findings Workflow
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Discovery] --> B[Log to Security Findings Repo]
    B --> C[Triage Severity (CVSS)]
    C --> D[Assign to Domain Owner]
    D --> E[Fix Window SLA]
    E --> F[Re-Test and Validate]
    F --> G[Close Ticket]
```
- All findings are filed in GitHub Issues via `sec-finding-template.md`
- CVSS 8.0+ findings trigger escalation to Platform Security Steering Committee

---

## 5. Reporting & Dashboards
- **Quarterly Threat Exposure Report** shared with CTO, CISO, EMs
- **Findings Heatmap** by domain, severity, and aging (via Backstage plugin)
- **Time-to-Fix SLAs**: Benchmarked by service tier (P0, P1, P2)

---

## 6. Remediation Governance
- **Security Champions**: Help coordinate fixes within domain teams
- **AppSec Leads**: Validate mitigation adequacy and retest
- **Scorecard**: Reviewed monthly with architecture & infra governance boards

---

## Summary
By embedding a disciplined cadence of external pen tests, internal red teaming, and continuous triage via bug bounty, the RideShareApp Platform ensures offensive security is integrated into platform maturity. The objective is simple: expose before we’re exposed—through automation, simulation, and actionable reporting.
