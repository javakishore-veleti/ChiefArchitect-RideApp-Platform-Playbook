## 2. Compliance Objectives
- **Data Residency**: Enforce region-specific storage for rider and driver data (e.g., EU, India)
- **Access Control**: RBAC policies aligned with engineering roles and support zones
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs for every transaction involving sensitive or financial data
- **Third-party Reviews**: Annual review of integrated SDKs, ML APIs, payment processors
- **Incident Disclosure**: Breach notification process within regulatory timelines

---

## 3. Governance Structure
- **Platform Risk Officer (PRO)**: Central owner of risk registry and audits
- **Embedded Risk Champions**: Named per domain (e.g., Pricing, Fleet, ML Ops)
- **Quarterly Risk Reviews**: Includes incident analysis, new threats, policy updates
- **Internal Audit Checklist**: Linked to `/Templates-and-References/Security-Compliance-Audit.md`

---

## 4. Risk Management Practices
- **Threat Modeling**: Required for new public endpoints and partner integrations
- **Secrets Hygiene**: Enforced rotation cycles, vault policies, access expiry triggers
- **Red Team Drills**: Annual scenario-driven testing of service compromise and escalation readiness
- **Change Management**: Peer-reviewed rollouts, CAB sign-off for Tier-1 infrastructure changes
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runtime policies (OPA), intrusion detection (Falco), anomaly triggers

---

## 5. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch internal compliance scorecard for each service
- **Q3**: Expand GDPR tagging and PII lineage tracing in data pipeline
- **Q4**: Enable policy-as-code gates for SLO coverage and secrets lifecycle adherence
