# Data Governance and Stewardship – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a RideShareApp-specific data governance and stewardship strategy that promotes responsible usage, regulatory compliance, discoverability, and high data quality across all trip-related, driver-partner, rider, marketplace, and ML-derived datasets.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- **Data is a Platform Asset**: Every dataset generated within the RideShareApp ecosystem (e.g., Trip events, Matching signals, Driver profiles) is governed as a product.
- **Stewardship First**: Assigned stewards are responsible for schema health, lineage visibility, freshness, and metadata completeness.
- **Federated Governance**: Platform-wide policies (e.g., PII tagging, retention) are enforced by distributed data domain owners.
- **Mobility-centric Privacy**: Policies comply with GDPR, India DPDP, CPRA, and are sensitive to geo-fencing, PII at rest/in transit, and auditability.

## 2. Stewardship Roles & Responsibilities
| Role            | Responsibility                                                                                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Stewards    | Govern schema evolution (e.g., trip lifecycle updates), tag PII, maintain Backstage metadata     |
| Domain Owners    | Approve data contracts across services (e.g., Rider → Matching → ETA), manage retention policies  |
| Compliance Leads | Perform audits across driver payout, rating, and location logs                                   |
| Data Platform    | Operate ingestion tooling, schema registries, feature store catalog, and freshness monitors       |

---

## 3. Governance Domains (RideShareApp-specific)
| Domain           | Examples of Governed Entities                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trips            | trip_id, rider_id, driver_id, booking timestamp, fare             |
| Matching Engine  | surge_factor, zone_density, rider_wait_time                        |
| Driver Profiles  | driver_id, license_doc_hash, geo-zone availability                |
| Payments         | fare split, promo_code, tax breakdown, refund metadata            |
| Marketplace Ops  | incentive policy, batch zones, driver supply signal               |
| ML Features      | predicted_demand_score, eta_skew, driver_cancellation_risk        |

---

## 4. Governance Mechanisms
- **Data Contracts**: All Kafka, API, and BigQuery-based flows must version schemas with consumer approval
- **Stewardship Registry**: YAML file per domain listing steward, lineage diagram link, and retention duration
- **Tagging & Classification**: PII fields like `rider_email`, `driver_license_hash`, or `location_history` must be explicitly tagged
- **Lineage Mapping**: Auto-generated via dbt and protobuf graph overlays, visualized in Backstage plugin
- **Schema Evolution Policy**: No breaking changes allowed without 2+ downstream owner sign-offs

---

## 5. Tools & Infrastructure
- **Data Catalog**: Unified metadata viewer (e.g., Backstage + Amundsen hybrid) integrated with Feature Store
- **Schema Registry**: Kafka, BigQuery, Snowflake, and ML contract metadata exposed via internal GraphQL layer
- **Access Control**: Tiered RBAC (read/write/PII access), tracked by audit trail and tied to engineering squads
- **Monitoring**: P0 tables must have freshness, null rate, row count, and semantic drift checks with alerts

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch catalog auto-tagging engine across Trip/Driver/Matching tables
- **Q3**: Deploy real-time lineage + impact analysis view for all production dataflows
- **Q4**: Automate schema diff detection and Slack alerts for invalid downstream access after deploys

---

## Summary
Data Governance and Stewardship at RideShareApp ensures datasets critical to mobility experiences—from booking to drop-off—are accurate, secure, compliant, and high-fidelity. It enables data producers and consumers to operate transparently while supporting ML scale-out, regulatory defense, and platform observability.


# Data Governance and Stewardship – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define an enterprise-wide data governance and stewardship strategy that promotes responsible data usage, regulatory compliance, discoverability, and high data quality across the RideShareApp Platform.

---

## 1. Core Principles
- **Data is a Product**: Each dataset must have an owner, consumer-facing contracts, and SLAs.
- **Stewardship First**: Domain stewards must govern schema evolution, data lineage, tagging, and documentation.
- **Federated Governance**: Central policies + distributed enforcement by domain data owners.
- **Privacy by Design**: PII and sensitive data are protected at rest, in transit, and by access policies.

## 2. Stewardship Roles & Responsibilities
| Role            | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Stewards    | Govern schema changes, tag PII, maintain catalog metadata                      |
| Domain Owners    | Approve data contracts, manage retention and lineage for their datasets        |
| Compliance Leads | Audit access, ensure regulatory alignment (GDPR, CCPA, India DPDP)             |
| Data Platform    | Operate tooling (catalogs, schema registry, retention automation)              |

## 4. Governance Mechanisms
- **Data Contracts**: Required for all domain APIs and streaming pipelines
- **Stewardship Registry**: YAML or metadata table listing steward contacts per dataset

- **Lineage Mapping**: Auto-generated via dbt, Kafka, and ML pipeline hooks
- **Schema Evolution Policy**: Enforced through CI/CD with version checks and diff reviews
