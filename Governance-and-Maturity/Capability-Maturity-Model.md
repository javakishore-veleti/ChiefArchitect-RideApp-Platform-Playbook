# Capability Maturity Model – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a structured Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to evaluate, benchmark, and improve engineering and architectural practices across the RideShareApp Platform. This model helps align teams to RideShareApp-specific platform expectations, uncover technical risk, and inform investment priorities tied to real-time mobility, reliability, and growth.

---

## 1. Model Overview
The CMM is organized into **five levels**, each reflecting increasing maturity across platform-relevant capability areas for RideShareApp’s microservices, AI/ML systems, partner APIs, and operational tooling.

| Level | Name           | Description                                                       |
|-------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Initial        | Ad hoc, inconsistent practices, reactive firefighting across mobility domains |
| 2     | Managed        | Defined practices within city-based pods, emerging reuse         |
| 3     | Standardized   | Shared standards, golden paths for ride matching, driver tracking, surge pricing |
| 4     | Quantified     | Metrics-driven reliability and SLO enforcement across trip lifecycle workflows  |
| 5     | Optimizing     | Continuous refinement, edge case automation, ML-feedback loops across platform |

---

## 2. Capability Areas
Each domain is assessed independently across maturity levels for the RideShareApp Platform:

| Domain                | Examples of Capabilities                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service Architecture  | Bounded context design for Pricing, ETA, Matching services                     |
| Observability         | Live rider/driver flow tracing, latency budget enforcement, anomaly alerts     |
| CI/CD                 | Canary rollout of routing engine, rollback safe blue-green for surge changes  |
| Security              | Region-aware secrets, runtime policy-as-code, driver PII protection            |
| Data Governance       | Trip event schema evolution, localized retention policies by geo               |
| API Strategy          | OpenAPI compliance for Driver SDK, dynamic partner quota control               |
| Testing               | Geo-A/B test support, contract tests for Fleet APIs, simulation replays        |
| Documentation         | Service-specific trip diagrams, fraud ML lifecycle SOPs, matching workflows    |
| Developer Experience  | Local emulation of full trip flow, live preview of PR environments             |

---

## 3. Scoring Mechanism
- Each capability is rated from **1 to 5** using scorecards tailored for RideShareApp domains
- Weights applied based on user-facing impact, fleet uptime, or regional scale complexity
- Self-assessment + platform architect-led review model
- Quarterly visualization with heatmaps by vertical (Rider, Driver, Ops, AI)

---

## 4. Usage
- **Service Reviews**: Applied during Platform Architecture Review walkthroughs for key flows (trip, surge, routing)
- **Team OKRs**: OKRs tied to maturity uplift for critical regions or services
- **Platform Health Dashboards**: Maturity overlaid with SLO, error rate, and velocity metrics
- **Tech Debt Planning**: Prioritized refactor backlog for driver/rider risk mitigation

---

## 5. Governance
- Maintained by the **RideShareApp Platform Architecture Council**
- Reviewed semi-annually in conjunction with trip flow KPIs and incident root cause themes
- Rubrics versioned in `/Templates-and-References/Maturity-Matrix.yaml` and updated by zone owners

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Launch self-assessment portal integrated with Backstage service metadata
- **Q3**: Enable maturity heatmap overlays on trip tracing and SLA dashboards
- **Q4**: Correlate maturity with ride-level KPIs (drop-offs, timeouts, cost regression)

---

## Summary
The Capability Maturity Model enables the RideShareApp Platform to consistently raise its bar for engineering excellence, domain agility, and operational predictability. It brings visibility to strengths and gaps—so every service team can evolve to meet the scale and speed of a growing, real-time mobility platform.
