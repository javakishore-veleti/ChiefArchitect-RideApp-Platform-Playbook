# Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
To establish a structured, platform-wide approach for conducting Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) in the RideShareApp ecosystem to ensure compliance with global data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, India DPDP, CPRA) and protect the rights and expectations of riders, drivers, and partners.

---

## 1. When to Conduct a PIA
PIAs are mandatory when a feature, system, or integration involves:
- Collection or processing of **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Geo-location tracking of riders or drivers
- **Automated decision-making**, e.g., ML-powered dynamic pricing or ETA models
- Third-party data sharing (e.g., partners, insurers, payment gateways)
- New forms of behavioral tracking or data enrichment

---

## 2. PIA Workflow (RideShareApp)
1. **Trigger**: ADR, feature spec, or API proposal includes a PIA flag
2. **Scoping**: Define actors, flows, and data categories affected
3. **Risk Identification**: Use Data Protection Impact Questionnaire
4. **Mitigation Design**: Recommend purpose limitation, minimization, and access control policies
5. **Review & Signoff**: Privacy Review Board and Security Architects
6. **Storage**: PIA is versioned in GitHub under `/privacy-assessments/<feature>.md`

- Launch Date:

## 2. Data Processed
| Data Type        | Purpose                         | Retention | Classification |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| rider_email      | account notifications           | 90 days   | PII             |
| location_history | trip routing, ETA estimation    | 30 days   | Sensitive       |

## 3. Data Flow
- Collected via: [e.g., Rider App v4.3 API]
- Stored in: [e.g., trip_events table, encrypted BQ partition]
- Shared with: [e.g., insurance partners via gateway API]

## 4. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                           | Mitigation                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Excessive retention             | Auto-deletion jobs per GDPR config            |
| Consent not enforced            | Embedded consent layer in Rider onboarding    |
| Lack of downstream visibility  | Catalog lineage trace via Backstage plugin    |

## 5. Review Summary
- Reviewed by: [Privacy Lead, Platform Security]
- Status: [Approved / Needs Rework / On Hold]
- Date:
```

---

## 4. Tooling & Support
- **Consent-as-a-Service**: Embedded platform APIs to manage opt-in/out flows
- **Privacy Classification Scanner**: CI tool tagging schema fields (e.g., PII, Geo, Financial)
- **Backstage PIA Plugin**: Browse past PIAs, trigger new workflows, link to ADRs

---

## 5. Governance & Oversight
- **Privacy Review Board**: Multi-functional panel (Legal, Security, Data Platform, Product)
- **Quarterly Audits**: Spot-check 5% of PIA-approved features for enforcement validation
- **P0 Policy**: No new Rider/Driver data flows go to production without a signed PIA

---

## Summary
Privacy Impact Assessments are a foundational safeguard in RideShareApp’s commitment to ethical, secure, and compliant data handling. The PIA process is both a design-time policy gate and a mechanism for accountability that evolves with platform maturity and regulation.
