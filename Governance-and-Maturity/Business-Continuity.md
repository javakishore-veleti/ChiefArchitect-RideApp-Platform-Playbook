# Business Continuity Planning (BCP) – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Define a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for the RideShareApp Platform to ensure minimal disruption, rapid recovery, and sustained service delivery in the face of operational crises, disasters, or regional outages.

## 1. Scope of Continuity Planning
| Domain                   | BCP Scenario Examples                                                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Platform Services        | Complete trip booking outage, ETA engine failure in a region              |
| Data Infrastructure      | GCP BigQuery access disruption, Pub/Sub message queue failures            |
| Mobile Operations        | App store deployment block, mobile SDK signing breach                     |
| Third-party Integrations | Partner API downtime (payments, ID verification), geo-routing disruptions |
| Workforce Operations     | Widespread remote access issues, VPN or IdP downtime                      |

---

## 2. BCP Framework Phases
1. **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: Identify critical services (Tier 1–3) and their recovery objectives (RTO/RPO)
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate service dependencies, single points of failure, and region-specific risks
3. **Mitigation Planning**: High availability designs, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms
4. **Response Plan**: Escalation trees, hot-site/secondary cluster activation, stakeholder comms
5. **Recovery & Restoration**: Service failover validation, data reconciliation, customer impact review

---

## 3. Recovery Objectives by Tier
| Tier  | Example Services                   | RTO   | RPO   |
|-------|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Tier 1| Booking, Matching, Payments         | 15 min | 5 min  |
| Tier 2| Notifications, Ratings, Trip Events | 1 hr   | 15 min |
| Tier 3| Admin Dashboards, Analytics         | 4 hrs  | 1 hr   |

---

## 4. Platform Redundancy Strategy
- **Multi-Region GKE Clusters**: Rider-facing workloads in `us-west1`, `us-central1`, `asia-southeast1`
- **Read-Replicas for Datastores**: Read-heavy APIs backed by globally distributed Postgres replicas
- **Model Backup Pipelines**: Daily sync of production ML models to cold-region storage
- **Partner Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for payments and KYC via alternate verified providers

## 5. BCP Testing & Drills
| Type of Exercise      | Frequency  | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tabletop Simulation    | Quarterly  | Simulate region-wide trip service disruption                 |
| Failover Dry Run       | Bi-annually| Test multi-region rerouting, DNS TTL flushing                |
| Chaos Engineering Drill| Monthly    | Inject latency/failure into Booking/ETA APIs using Gremlin   |
| Data Restore Test      | Quarterly  | Recover trip_event logs from backup in <60 min               |

---

## 6. Governance
- **Continuity Steering Committee**: EMs, SRE, TPMs, Data Engineering, Legal
- **Annual Policy Review**: Validate contact chains, update tier classification, test new services
- **Customer Comms Framework**: Pre-approved language, templated status page updates, rider/driver channels

---

## Summary
RideShareApp’s Business Continuity Plan ensures that mission-critical functions remain resilient even during severe operational events. With structured drills, redundancy layers, and domain-driven recovery strategies, the platform is prepared to serve reliably—no matter the disruption.
