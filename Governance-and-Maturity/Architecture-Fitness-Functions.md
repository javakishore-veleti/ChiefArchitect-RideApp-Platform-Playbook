# Architecture Fitness Functions – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Introduce architecture fitness functions as continuous, automated mechanisms to ensure that the evolving architecture of the RideShareApp Platform adheres to its core principles—scalability, reliability, modularity, and observability.

---

## 1. What Are Fitness Functions?
Fitness functions are measurable, executable checks that validate architectural characteristics and ensure intentional design over time, especially as codebases grow and teams scale.

They:
- Act like unit tests for architecture
- Run continuously in CI/CD pipelines
- Are owned by platform architects and domain teams

---

## 2. Types of Fitness Functions
| Type                  | Example (RideShareApp Context)                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Code           | Enforce dependency boundaries between Matching, Pricing, and Fleet     |
| Runtime Behavior      | Validate circuit breaker behavior under surge load                     |
| Observability         | Ensure every new service exposes standard metrics + trace context      |
| Topological           | Confirm service mesh boundaries (no lateral traffic bypass)            |
| Compliance            | Ensure services handling PII are registered with correct data tags     |
| Cost/Latency Drift    | Alert when new feature increases p99 latency beyond defined envelope    |

## 3. Examples in RideShareApp
- **FleetService → PricingService**: Alert if direct API call is made (should go through EventBus)
- **TripService**: Fails pipeline if logs don’t include RiderID + RequestID
- **MatchingService**: Validates canary deployment stage uses 10% traffic for 10 mins
- **MLScoringPipeline**: Checks that retrained model did not increase API latency beyond 5% of baseline

---

## 4. Tooling & Automation
- **CI/CD Hooks**: Integrated with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD
- **Custom Linters**: For proto interfaces, YAML manifests, and trace headers
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**: For platform rules (e.g., must use shared AuthLib)
- **Dashboards**: Weekly pass/fail metrics by domain team

---

## 5. Governance
- Each service must implement at least **2 fitness functions** before go-live
- Architects maintain registry of functions in `/architecture/fitness-functions.yaml`
- Reviewed during architectural walk-throughs and post-incident reviews

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Auto-generate fitness functions from Backstage service metadata
- **Q3**: Establish latency/cost regressions as top-level fitness metrics
- **Q4**: Launch simulation environment for proactive function validation (e.g., load, chaos)

---

## Summary
Architecture fitness functions help RideShareApp Platform maintain structural integrity and system guarantees as it evolves. They reduce architectural drift, catch regressions early, and build confidence that new changes respect platform constraints—enabling teams to move fast without breaking the foundation.
