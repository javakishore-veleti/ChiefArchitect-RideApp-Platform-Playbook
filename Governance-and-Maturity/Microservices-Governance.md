# Microservices Governance – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a robust governance model for microservices within the RideShareApp Platform that balances service autonomy with platform consistency, ensuring scalability, security, observability, and alignment with domain-driven design principles.

---

## 1. Governance Principles
- **Decentralized Ownership, Central Standards**: Service teams build autonomously but align on contracts, observability, and infra usage.
- **API First**: All services are defined with OpenAPI specs, version-controlled.
- **Golden Paths**: Recommended scaffolds and patterns for high-quality services.
- **Guardrails, Not Gates**: Enable fast delivery with embedded policy checks and validations.
- **Platform Interoperability**: Ensure services integrate cleanly into shared infrastructure (CI/CD, observability, secrets, etc.)

## 2. Core Service Expectations
| Capability               | Expectation                                                           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Domain Ownership         | Mapped to a single functional domain (e.g., Matching, ETA, Payments)   |
| Observability            | Exports logs, metrics, traces by default                              |
| API Contracts            | OpenAPI spec, JSON schema, versioning, backwards compatibility checks  |
| Deployment Safety        | Canary support, rollback strategies, health checks                    |
| Security Compliance      | RBAC, secrets management, threat model filed                          |
| Data Stewardship         | Schema ownership, lineage tracking, PII tagging                       |
| SLOs & SLIs              | Must publish `/slo.yaml` and track error budgets                      |

---

## 3. Service Lifecycle Governance
- **Design Review**: Architecture walkthroughs for new services or major changes
- **Go-Live Checklist**: Includes SLOs, runbooks, fitness functions, threat model
- **Fitness Functions**: Two+ per service, enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- **Onboarding Registry**: Must register with service catalog (e.g., Backstage)
- **Deprecation Policy**: Sunset playbook with consumer notification and observability cleanup

---

## 4. Platform Enforcement Mechanisms
- **CI/CD Lint Rules**: Validate repo structure, tagging, doc coverage
- **OPA Policy Checks**: Infra-as-code, resource permissions, image sources
- **Service Catalog Validation**: Ensure ownership, API versioning, SLO metadata
- **Error Budget Alerts**: Route to Slack and incident review process when SLOs breach

---

## 5. Governance Roles
- **Service Owners**: Ensure compliance, own lifecycle, and respond to escalations
- **Platform Architects**: Maintain scaffolds, guardrails, and evolve governance standards
- **SREs**: Validate SLOs, monitor reliability, guide on-call playbook hygiene
- **Security & Data Leads**: Review threat models, secrets usage, PII compliance

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: Expand golden path templates with policy-as-code and observability prewiring
- **Q3**: Launch service governance scorecards and gap heatmaps
- **Q4**: Platform-wide dashboard for SLO conformance and incident correlation

---

## Summary
The Microservices Governance model ensures that RideShareApp’s growing constellation of services remains composable, observable, secure, and resilient. It provides clear expectations for teams and the tools to uphold architectural integrity without slowing down innovation.
