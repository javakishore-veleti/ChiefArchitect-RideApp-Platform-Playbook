# SLOs, SLIs, and Error Budgets – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Establish a consistent and business-aligned approach to defining, tracking, and governing Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and Error Budgets across the RideShareApp Platform. These metrics ensure that critical experiences for riders, drivers, and partners are measurable, reliable, and prioritized.

---

## 1. Definitions
- **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**: A quantitative measure of service behavior.
- **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: A target value or threshold for an SLI.
- **Error Budget**: The allowable threshold of failure over a time window, calculated as `1 - SLO`.

## 2. Tiering & Prioritization
| Tier | Service Type               | SLO Target         | Examples                                |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Rider/Driver-facing Core    | 99.95% availability| Trip Booking, Pricing, ETA Engine       |
| 2    | Operations/Marketplace      | 99.9%              | Incentives, Ratings, Fraud Checks       |
| 3    | Analytics/Internal Systems  | 99.5%              | Reporting Pipelines, Batch ML Jobs      |

## 3. Common SLIs
| Category           | SLI Description                                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability       | % of successful requests over total                      |
| Latency (P99)      | Request completion within target ms threshold            |
| Freshness          | Data arrival time for live pricing and demand signals    |
| Queue Depth        | Task backlog across trip lifecycle or dispatch queues    |
| Retry Rate         | % of requests requiring retry due to timeouts or errors  |

---

## 4. Error Budgets
- Calculated over rolling 30-day windows
- Trigger **freeze on feature deployments** when budget exhausted
- Budgets partitioned by geography for regional SLA tracking (e.g., Bengaluru vs. NYC)
- Tracked at:
  - **Service Level** (e.g., Surge Engine)
  - **Flow Level** (e.g., Book → Match → Assign → Start Trip)

---

## 5. Governance
- Owned by domain service teams
- Platform SRE and architecture teams publish weekly dashboards
- Review SLO violations during **Incident Postmortems**
- SLO/SLI set as part of new service go-live checklists
- Tier-1 services must define and publish SLO YAML in `/service-metadata/slo.yaml`

---

## 6. Roadmap
- **Q2**: SLO authoring UI + linter integration into GitHub PRs
- **Q3**: Error Budget burn heatmap per metro geography
- **Q4**: SLO-backed throttling controls tied to real-time flow impact

---

## Summary
The SLO, SLI, and Error Budget model enables RideShareApp Platform to track system health in customer-centric terms, prevent over-optimizing for velocity, and promote a culture of operational excellence grounded in measurable risk.
