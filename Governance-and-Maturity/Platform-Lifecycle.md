## 1. Lifecycle Stages
| Stage             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ideation          | Evaluate business drivers, technical feasibility, compliance, and SLAs      |
| Planning          | Align with domains (e.g., Trips, Pricing, Driver) and build capability roadmaps |
| Launch            | Enablement docs, SDKs, rollout gates, golden paths, feature flag integration |
| Stabilization     | SLO tuning, incident playbooks, support rotations, A/B test guardrails       |
| Growth            | Multi-region deployment, tenant scaling, usage-based alerting, auto-onboarding |
| Maturity          | Usage benchmarks, tech debt scorecards, component ownership accountability   |
| Sunset            | Transition plan, API deprecation headers, data archival policies             |

## 2. Platform Domains Under Management
- **Trip Execution Stack**: Booking, ETA, Trip-State Engine
- **Marketplace Optimization**: Matching, Pricing, Surge Engine
- **Driver & Rider Platforms**: SDKs, Profile, Ratings, Fraud Detection
- **Edge & Orchestration**: API Gateway, Service Mesh, Envoy Filters
- **Data & AI**: Feature Store, Forecasting Pipelines, Personalization

## 3. Key Artifacts by Stage
| Artifact                        | Lifecycle Stage(s)              |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Architecture Decision Records  | Planning, Launch                |
| API Versioning Contracts       | Launch, Growth, Sunset          |
| Platform Usage Dashboards      | Stabilization, Growth, Maturity |
| Tech Debt Remediation Plans    | Maturity                        |
| Deprecation Playbooks          | Sunset                          |

## 4. Governance Routines
| Forum                          | Frequency      | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Platform Steering Committee    | Monthly        | Prioritize enhancements, cross-team alignment     |
| Lifecycle Review Checkpoints   | Quarterly      | Audit stage transitions, tech debt gates          |
| Sunset Readiness Council       | As-needed      | Evaluate readiness for sunsetting and migration   |
| Platform Feedback Reviews      | Monthly        | Collate Rider/Driver/Squad pain points            |

---

## 5. Automation & Tooling
- **Lifecycle Tags in Backstage**: Stages like `experimental`, `stable`, `deprecated`
- **Metrics Pipelines**: SLO trends, adoption rate, error budgets by platform domain
- **API Maturity Registry**: Tracks usage, age, contract compliance, and sunset headers
- **Platform Compass**: Centralized visualization of lifecycle phase per capability

## 6. Platform Exit Criteria by Stage
| Lifecycle Stage  | Exit Criteria Example                                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ideation         | Business case approved, P0 KPIs drafted                                    |
| Launch           | Documentation complete, 100% test coverage, pilot squad onboarded         |
| Stabilization    | <1 incident/week, SLOs met, 95% alert coverage                             |
| Growth           | Scaled to 3+ regions, <2% 99p latency degradation under 10x load           |
| Maturity         | Observability fully integrated, self-service onboarding enabled            |
| Sunset           | Users migrated, contract expiry, platform deletion PR merged               |
