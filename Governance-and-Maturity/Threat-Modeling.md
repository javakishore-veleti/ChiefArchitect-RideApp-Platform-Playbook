# Threat Modeling – RideShareApp Platform

## Objective
Introduce a platform-wide threat modeling framework for the RideShareApp ecosystem that helps identify, prioritize, and mitigate security risks across services, APIs, ML models, and third-party integrations—before they reach production.

---

## 1. Why Threat Modeling Matters for RideShareApp
- **Mobility Context**: Rider location, driver identity, and trip data are high-value targets.
- **Real-time Operations**: Disruptions to ETA, Matching, or Payment can degrade real-time user trust.
- **Geo-distributed Compliance**: Threats differ across jurisdictions (India DPDP, GDPR, CPRA).

## 2. Threat Modeling Process
| Step                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Define Scope       | Identify assets (data, endpoints, APIs) and entry points                    |
| 2. Decompose System   | Diagram workflows (e.g., Booking flow, Driver Matching, Trip Completion)    |
| 3. Identify Threats   | STRIDE categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, etc.)                  |
| 4. Assess Risk        | Use DREAD or CVSS-based scoring per threat                                  |
| 5. Mitigate           | Document mitigations, fallback paths, rate limits, validation               |
| 6. Validate & Review  | Peer-reviewed by Security Champions + Architects                            |

## 3. Platform-Specific Scenarios
| Domain            | Example Threats                                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trip Booking      | Spoofed driver ID, replay attack on surge fare endpoint                        |
| Payments          | MITM on promo-code API, tampering with wallet refund payload                   |
| Driver Onboarding | License OCR poisoning, synthetic identity creation                             |
| ML Serving        | Model inversion, input fuzzing, feature drift attack                           |
| Partner SDK       | Over-permissive scopes, lack of rate limiting, JWT misuse                      |

---

## 4. Templates & Tooling
- **threat-model.yaml**: Declares data types, APIs, roles, STRIDE map, and mitigation plans
- **Diagram-as-Code**: Use C4 or Mermaid to represent system flow diagrams and threat zones
- **Security Review Tracker**: All models linked via Backstage + GitHub annotations
- **Playbooks**: Library of common mitigations (e.g., replay guards, token binding, claim filtering)

---

## 5. Roles & Cadence
| Role                 | Responsibilities                                                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security Champions   | Drive initial modeling, tooling literacy                                 |
| Domain Architects    | Ensure all new ADRs include threat modeling section                      |
| SRE & Platform Sec   | Validate models before high-risk features go live                        |
| TPMs                 | Track mitigation action items post-review                                |

- **Frequency**: Required for all Tier 1 services and feature rollouts
- **Trigger Points**: New APIs, third-party integrations, ML models, infra topology changes
